Wireless Sensor networks have currently drawn a lot of interest due to the range of applications they enable. A wireless sensor network is a special kind of ah-hoc network with distributed sensing and processing capability that can be used in a wide range of applications, such as free-way traffic, wildlife monitoring, environmental monitoring, industrial applications, precision agriculture, and military applications. Sensor networks permit cost-effective sensing mainly in applications where human observation or traditional sensors would be costly, dangerous, inefficient, and detrimental. Since sensor networks are widely deployed, they are exposed to various security threats that can adversely affect the success of important applications. Securing sensor networks have been an ongoing challenge due to their unique nature as an application and a network, and due to their limited capabilities. Wireless sensor networks may be more vulnerable to attacks, because of their potential for physical isolation. Additionally, due to their low processor capabilities, wireless sensor networks do not have the capacity to utilize sophisticated anti-intrusion prevention technologies. The deeper sensors are embedded into an environment the more frequently the case that they will become more vulnerable to physical attacks and potentially compromising sensor nodes' security. For example, an attacker may provide incorrect location references by replaying the beacon packets intercepted in different locations. Moreover, an attacker may compromise a beacon node and distribute malicious location references by lying about the beacon node's location or manipulating the beacon signal. In either of these circumstances, the non-beacon nodes will incorrectly establish their locations. Therefore, securing sensor nodes is an important factor in deployment. Cryptography can be employed to help protect wireless sensor networks from the various threats of hostile attacks. Cryptography's objective in a wireless sensor network is to construct methods or protocols that can still exe achieve certain tasks even in the presence of an adversary. On the other hand, cryptanalysis is embedded into a wireless sensor network in order to attempt to circumvent any type of cryptographic scheme. In many instances, cryptanalysis outweighs cryptography by far. Subsequently, in a wireless sensor network if cryptanalysis outweighs cryptography then the sensor network is at a high risk of opening the network for numerous hostile attacks. Sensor nodes that have cryptographic algorithms, protocols, or scheme are more likely survive a cryptanalysis attack or hostile attack than sensor nodes that are unprotected from such threats. These small devices contain confidential data that is deemed significant to that environment in which it is monitoring. On the other hand, if a sensor network attacked by an adversary this could cause the entire network to fail in maintaining confidentiality. Maintaining a cryptanalysis free environment determines the success of a senor network. Nevertheless, the ability to maintain a cryptanalysis free environment is the ultimate goal of a wireless senor network. In the paper, the focus is to show the importance maintaining an efficient cryptographic wireless sensor network versus a cryptanalysis wireless senor network. © 2007 IEEE.;;"Cryptanalysis; Free way traffic; Multifunctional sensor nodes; Wildlife monitoring; Ad hoc networks; Cryptography; Industrial applications; Telecommunication traffic; Wireless telecommunication systems; Wireless sensor networks";Conference Paper;Scopus

These characteristics, a complex supply chain and wide availability of data make the industry a suitable avenue for efficient supply chain management practices. The industry has also been in a transition over the last 20 years: significant consolidation in retail, majority of apparel manufacturing operations moving overseas and, more recently, increasing use of electronic commerce in retail and wholesale trade. This paper aims to review the current state of operations and recent trends across the fashion supply chain in the US. We use industry-wide data, articles from business journals, industry reviews and extensive interviews with an apparel manufacturer in California, and a major US department store chain to describe the current operational practices and how the industry is restructuring itself during the transition, focusing at the apparel manufacture and retail segments of the supply chain. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Many control applications require hard real-time channels, where the delay and jitter are in the levels of milliseconds or less. To the best of our knowledge, no encryption algorithm is fast enough for hard real-time channels of existing industrial fieldbuses and, therefore, made mission-critical applications vulnerable to cyberattacks, e.g., delay and data injection attacks. In this article, we propose a novel recursive watermark (RWM) algorithm for hard real-time control system data integrity validation. Using a watermark key, a transmitter applies watermark noise to hard real-time signals and sends through the unencrypted hard real-time channel. The same key is transferred to the receiver by the encrypted nonreal-time channel. With the same key, the receiver can detect if the data have been modified by the attackers and take action to prevent catastrophic damages. We provide analysis and methods to design proper watermark keys to ensure reliable attack detection. We use a ship propulsion control system for the simulation-based case study, where our algorithm smoothly shuts down the system after attacks. We also evaluated the algorithm speed on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller (PLC). This hardware experiment demonstrated that the RWM algorithm takes about 2.8~\mu \text{s} to add or validate the watermark noise on one sample data point. As a comparison, common cryptic hashing algorithms can hardly process a small data set under 100 ms. The proposed RWM is about 32 to 1375 times faster than the standard approaches. Note to Practitioners - It is widely believed that the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies will seamlessly connect countless smart devices, profoundly change the industry. Traditionally, field devices within the feedback control loops are isolated from the Internet by secure gateways. In the future, field devices will connect to the Internet in a more direct manner. To the best of our knowledge, no encryption algorithm is fast enough for hard real-time channels of existing industrial fieldbuses and, therefore, made mission-critical applications vulnerable to cyberattacks. We propose a novel recursive watermark (RWM) algorithm for hard real-time control system data integrity validation. This article serves industry practitioners in three ways. First, it is a timely caution to industrial IoT (IIoT) pilot users on the security challenges in real-time channels. Once a compromised edge device is connected to a field device, attackers have unlimited means to jeopardize valuable assets. In this article, we gave an example where attackers may damage shipboard assets by introducing millisecond-level delays. Second, since hard real-time encryption is not available, we propose a detour solution. With the proposed algorithm, even attackers may read the content in the real-time channel, and they cannot change it without being detected. We implemented the real-time RWM algorithms in structured control language (SCL) and tested on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller (PLC). Third, we provide theoretical analysis as design guidelines for practitioners to set up or customize the RWM algorithm per their specific applications. © 2004-2012 IEEE.;"Cyber resilience; cyber security; delay attack; industrial control system (ICSs); Internet of Things (IoT); watermark";"Automation; Computer circuits; Controllers; Cryptography; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Network security; Programmable logic controllers; Programmed control systems; Real time control; Ship propulsion; Ships; Watermarking; Encryption algorithms; Feedback control loops; Hard real-time control; Industrial control systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Mission critical applications; Programmable logic controllers (PLC); Propulsion control systems; Computer control systems";Article;Scopus

In product lifecycle, there are many participators constructing a complicated network with enormous product lifecycle data. It is difficult to manage data of digital twin efficiently and securely from the perspectives of data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity among the complicated network. Moreover, the virtual product is always updated to the latest state of the physical product by overwriting the history virtual product that records the development process of digital twin. To address abovementioned data management problems simultaneously, a data management method for digital twin of product based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. A peer-to-peer network is constructed to enhance data sharing efficiency among participators. The basic structure of blockchain is introduced, including block, chain, and transaction. The blockchain is used for data storage through cryptography that ensuring only eligible participators can access the corresponding data. The change sensitive characteristic of blockchain can ensure data authenticity as well. In addition, the concept of smart contract can be used to execute some actions automatically to increase data sharing efficiency. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data management method. The results show that the proposed method can solve the abovementioned data management problems simultaneously. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers;"Blockchain technology; Data management; Digital twin; Product lifecycle management";"Authentication; Blockchain; Data Sharing; Digital storage; Digital twin; Efficiency; Life cycle; Peer to peer networks; Data management problems; Development process; Management method; Physical products; Product life cycle management; Product lifecycle data; Product-life-cycle; Virtual products; Information management";Article;Scopus

Such trust does not extend to the exchange and the reuse of three-dimensional (3D) product models across the product life cycle because verifiable traceability in the product data is lacking. This assurance is especially crucial when ""siloed"" manufacturing functions produce the product data that is not fully interoperable and thus requires frequent reworking to enable its reuse. Previous research showed how public key infrastructure (X.509-PKI) from the X.509 standard could be used to embed digital signatures into the product data for the purposes of certification and traceability. This paper first provides an overview and review of technologies that could be integrated to support trust throughout the product life cycle. This paper then proposes a trust structure that supports several data transaction types. Then, the paper presents a case study for common configuration management (CM) workflows that are typically found in regulated industries. Finally, the paper draws conclusions and provides recommendations for further research for enabling the product life cycle of trust (PLOT). © 2019 by ASME.";;"Public key cryptography; Public utilities; Configuration management; Data transaction; Manufacturing functions; Product life cycles; Public key infrastructure; Review of technologies; Threedimensional (3-d); Trust structures; Life cycle";Article;Scopus

Localization protocols rely on physical properties of the transmitted signals, such as Time-of-Flight or Received Signal Strength, which can be altered or impersonated by various types of attacks. Therefore, classical encryption techniques cannot guarantee the security of these localization protocols. Most off-the-shelf positioning platforms do not address the flaws related to localization. In addition, designers have a limited access to the various protocols, filters and algorithms involved in the localization chain, which poses a considerable obstacle to propose security solutions. This paper presents a prototyping platform called SecureLoc, open at every layer, for evaluating secure indoor localization methods based on Ultra-Wide Band Impulse Response (UWB-IR) technology, with respect to the cost and integration constraints of the IoT. We show the potential of SecureLoc for security evaluation and countermeasures through the case study of a spoofed acknowledgment attack. A novel analysis and evaluation of this attack is proposed. The robustness of SecureLoc localization chain against this attack is evaluated. Insights on future enhancements of this attack and possible low-cost countermeasures are provided. © 2019 IEEE.;"802.15.4; prototyping platform; secure indoor localization; UWB-IR";"Cryptography; Impulse response; Internet of things; Ultra-wideband (UWB); 802.15.4; Analysis and evaluation; Indoor localization; Internet of thing (IOT); Localization protocols; Prototyping platform; Received signal strength; Sensitive application; Indoor positioning systems";Conference Paper;Scopus

The SRAM Physical Unclonable Function (SRAM-PUF) is a potential candidate for secure key generation. An SRAM-PUF is able to generate random and unique cryptographic keys based on start-up values by exploiting intrinsic manufacturing process variations. The reuse of the available on-chip SRAM memory in a system as a PUF might achieve useful cost efficiency. However, as CMOS technology scales down, aging-induced Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) becomes more pronounced resulting in asymmetric degradation of memory bit cells after prolonged storage of the same bit values. This causes unreliable start-up values for an SRAM-PUF. In this paper, the on-chip memory in the ARM architecture has been used as a case study to investigate reliability in an SRAM-PUF. We show that the bit probability in a 32-bit ARM instruction cache has a predictable pattern and hence predictable aging. Therefore, we propose using an instruction cache as a PUF to save silicon area. Furthermore, we propose a bit selection technique to mitigate the NBTI effect. We show that this technique can reduce the predicted bit error in an SRAM-PUF from 14.18% to 5.58% over 5 years. Consequently, as the bit error reduces, the area overhead of the error-correction circuitry is about 6 × smaller compared to that without a bit selection technique. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;"Aging; Physical unclonable function; Reliability; SRAM";"Aging of materials; ARM processors; Cache memory; Error correction; Hardware security; Negative bias temperature instability; Public key cryptography; Reliability; Sensor nodes; ARM architecture; Constrained sensors; Cryptographic key; Cryptographic primitives; Instruction caches; Internet of thing (IoTs); Manufacturing process variations; Selection techniques; Static random access storage";Article;Scopus

Different from state of the art direct folding proposals we introduce two cost-effective 3D Stacked Hybrid Adders with identical tier structure, which potentially makes the manufacturing of hardware wide-operand fast adders a reality. An N-bit adder implemented on a K identical tier stacked IC performs in parallel two N/K-bit additions on each tier according to the anticipated computation principle. Inter-tier carry signals performing the appropriate sum selection are propagated by TSVs. The practical implications of direct folding and of our hybrid carry-select/prefix approaches are evaluated by a thorough case study on 65 nm CMOS 3D adder implementations, for operand sizes up to 4,096 bits and 16 tiers. Our simulations indicate that in almost all configurations at least one of the two proposed 3D stacked hybrid approaches is faster than the fastest 3D folding approach.

Unlike the conventional silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) that are solely based on manufacturing process variation, RRAM has some intrinsic randomness in its physical mechanisms that can be utilized as entropy sources; for instance, resistance variation, random telegraph noise, and probabilistic switching behaviors.

In a Cloud manufacturing environment, how to effectively protect the sensitive feature information for a model owner while enabling the owner to flexibly share the rest of the CAD model with collaborators is an important yet challenging research issue. In this paper, an innovative partial encryption approach, which is able to represent a CAD model into the granularity of sharing information in order to address various collaboration scenarios and customized requirements from the model owner and collaborators, is presented. The approach is composed of a customized encryption algorithm for a CAD model, a key based customized authorization algorithm for collaborators to decrypt shared features in the model, and a customized geometric transformation method to support the effective protection model-based visualization of the model for collaboration. With this approach, a CAD model can be flexibly encrypted to realize partial sharing of features and safe protection of the rest of the model according to collaboration requirements. Meanwhile, during encryption and decryption, the CAD model is always manifold no matter which feature is encrypted or decrypted to ensure user friendliness, model validity, and robustness of the approach. A case study is used to verify and illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. This research is a new attempt to design a content-based and customized encryption approach applicable to CAD model-based collaboration in a Cloud manufacturing environment.

To this end we first identify and classify the potential of the direct folding approach on existing fast prefix adders, and then discuss the cost and performance of each strategy. Our analysis identifies as a major direct folding drawback the utilization of different structures on each tier. Thus, in order to alleviate this, we propose a novel 3D Stacked Hybrid Prefix/Carry-Select Adder with identical tier structure, which potentially makes the manufacturing of hardware wide-operand adders a reality. Such an N-bit carry select adder can be implemented with K identical tier stacked ICs, where each tier contains two N/K-bit fast prefix adders operating in parallel according to the computation anticipation principle. Their carry-out signals are cascaded through TSVs in order to perform the selection of the sums accordingly, which results in a delay with the asymptotic notation of O(log(N/K) + K). To evaluate the practical implications of direct folding and of the hybrid prefix/carry-select approaches we perform a thorough case study of 65nm CMOS 3D adder implementations for different operand sizes and number of tiers, and analyze various possible design tradeoffs. Our simulations indicate the hybrid prefix/carry-select approach can achieve speed gains over 3D folding based designs of between 29% and 54%, for 512-bit up to 4096-bit adders, respectively. Even though 3D folding requires less real estate, when considering a more appropriate metric for 3D design, i.e., delay-footprint-cost product, the hybrid prefix/carry-select approach substantially outperforms the folding one and provides delay-footprint-cost reductions between 17.97% and 94.05%. © 2013 IEEE.;"Adders; Cryptography; Three-dimensional integrated circuits; Through-silicon vias";"3-D stacked IC; Asymptotic notation; Carry select adders; Design tradeoff; Different structure; Prefix adders; Three dimensional integrated circuits; Through silicon vias; Adders; Computer architecture; Cryptography; Product design; Three dimensional";Conference Paper;Scopus

PUFs exploit unique sub-micron manufacturing variations in each device to generate characteristic responses. Each response is subject to noise, so a so called fuzzy embedder is required to use a PUF for reliable key reproduction. Index-Based Syndrome coding (IBS) is an information theoretically secure fuzzy embedder, introduced in 2010 [1]. This work derives a lower bound for the reliability of IBS-based fuzzy embedders, that depends on the characteristics of the PUF and the parameters of the fuzzy embedder. In addition, the channel capacity is applied as new criterion for fuzzy embedder evaluation. In this case, the channel capacity determines the maximum key size that can be embedded. The presented measure is complementary to security analysis and thus adds a new dimension for evaluating future encoding schemes for IBS-based fuzzy embedders. A case study demonstrates the practical impact of the contributions. © 2012 IEEE.;"Channel Capacity; Error Correction; Fuzzy Embedder; Index-Based Syndrome Coding (IBS); Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)";"Embedded device; Encoding schemes; Fuzzy Embedder; Index-Based Syndrome Coding (IBS); Key sizes; Key storage; Lower bounds; Manufacturing Variation; New dimensions; Physical unclonable functions; Security analysis; Submicron; Channel capacity; Error correction; Hardware; Cryptography";Conference Paper;Scopus

The impact of RFID deployment on various performance measures in regard to these applications is discussed. The study shows that when combined with effective decision-making schemes, RFID technologies facilitate operational visibility; thus improve productivity, reduce inventory levels, and enable reduction of environmental impact within the scope of life cycle engineering.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a system that helps facilitate and improve the quality of decision making, reduces the level of substandard goods, and facilitates data capturing and manipulation, to help a warehouses improve quality assurance in the inventory-receiving process with the support of technology. Design/methodology/approach - This system consists of three modules, which integrate the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, case-based reasoning (CBR), and fuzzy reasoning (FR) technique to help monitor food quality assurance activities. In the first module, the data collection module, raw warehouse and work station information are collected. In the second module, the data sorting module, the collected data are stored in a database. In this module, data are decoded, and the coding stored in the RFID tags are transformed into meaningful information. The last module is the decision-making module, through which the operation guidelines and optimal storage conditions are determined. Findings - To validate the feasibility of the proposed system, a case study was conducted in food manufacturing companies. A pilot run of the system revealed that the performance of the receiving operation assignment and food quality assurance activities improved significantly. Originality/value - In summary, the major contribution of this paper is to develop an effective infrastructure for managing food-receiving process and facilitating decision making in quality assurance. Integrating CBR and FR techniques to improve the quality of decision making on food inventories is an emerging idea. The system development roadmap demonstrates the way to future research opportunities for managing food inventories in the receiving operations and implementing artificial intelligent techniques in the logistics industry. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

However, in shop-floor management, DM companies usually confront challenges such as information gaps between different manufacturing units, slow responsiveness to customer changes, and poor visualization. The main reasons are lacking of efficient manufacturing data collection manners and software to support shop-floor management. This paper introduces an RFID-enabled real-time manufacturing execution system (RT-MES) for improving DM shop-floor management level in the perspective of illustrating the RT-MES software design and implementation. Several contributions from this paper are significant. First, a framework of RFID-enabled RT-MES is proposed, which is generic and helpful for enterprise information system (EIS) construction. Second, a plug-universal database-aided design (PUDAD) concept and its realization are elaborated, which could reduce RT-MES development and implementation cycle. Third, an interface middleware is reported to enable RT-MES real-time intercommunication with other EISs such as SAP ERP. Fourth, a real-life case study describes how RT-MES to enhance a typical DM firm's shop-floor management, which can be referenced by other DM companies when they initiate and implement RFID-enabled solutions. © 2011 IEEE.;;"Customer requirements; Data collection; Discrete manufacturing; Enterprise information system; Information gap; Leadtime; Management level; Manufacturing Execution System; Manufacturing units; Shop floor; Software design and implementation; Cryptography; Enterprise resource planning; Floors; Information systems; Manufacture; Middleware; Software design; Visualization; Discrete time control systems";Conference Paper;Scopus

The analyzer leverages radio frequencyidentification (RFID) information stored within the electronic product code(EPC) network.Design/methodology/approach - The system architecture of theproposed CNA is first discussed. A case study of the system application in a Hong Kong pharmaceutical manufacturing company then presents the adoptionprocess and the challenges encountered in such technologies. Findings - Compared with traditional approaches, the results show that the proposed RFID solution is reliable and is capable of discovering counterfeit distributions, as well as reducing the detection costs by means of higher product movement visibility within the supply chain. Practical implications - A prototype system has been constructed and trial implemented in a pharmaceutical manufacturing company. It proved to be of benefit to the manufacturer who is able to deter product counterfeiting effectively and visualize real-time supply chain data automatically. Originality/value - The proposed CNA is designed to overcome issues of information invisibility, which is considered a huge cost lost in the identification of counterfeit products, loss of sales and reputation associated with the counterfeiting, and ineffective product authentication in the manufacturing industry. This paper contributes to the RFID research in the counterfeiting area by studying the feasibility and practicality of shifting the focus of product identification from the traditional package redesign solutions to the visualization of the movement of the product (i.e. product supply chain) via the use of RFID and EPC. Furthermore, a pharmaceutical manufacturing site provided a case study for discussing the advantages, critical issues for implementation of the RFID system, and lessons learned. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Codes; Counterfeiting; Inventory control; Production management; Radio frequencies; Tracking";"Codes; Counterfeiting; Production management; Radio frequencies; Tracking; Crime; Cryptography; Electric network analysis; Inventory control; Manufacture; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio waves; Research; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Visualization; Distribution of goods";Article;Scopus

The literature on organizational learning, however, has tended to focus on aspects of knowledge that are pertinent at the macro-organizational level (i.e. the overall business). The authors attempt in this paper to address a relative void in the literature, aiming to demonstrate the inter-locking factors within an enterprise information system that relate knowledge management and organizational learning, via a model that highlights key factors within such an inter-relationship. This is achieved by extrapolating data from a manufacturing organization using a case study, with these data then modeled using a cognitive mapping technique (fuzzy cognitive mapping, FCM). The empirical enquiry explores an interpretivist view of knowledge, within an information systems evaluation (ISE) process, through the associated classification of structural, interpretive and evaluative knowledge. This is achieved by visualizing inter-relationships within the ISE decision-making approach in the case organization. A number of decision paths within the cognitive map are then identified such that a greater understanding of ISE can be sought. The authors therefore present a model that defines a relationship between knowledge management (KM) and organizational learning (OL), and highlights factors that can lead a firm to develop itself towards a learning organization. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Since, many industries in India either have implemented PDM or are considering implementation, it is the right time to study the real impact of PDM in Indian industries. This impact study was made by the responses obtained through a survey questionnaire. The main objective of the survey is to study the impact of PDM implementation on productivity. The variables of productivity measurement in terms of Key Performance Areas have been identified using Performance Objective-Productivity model. The questionnaire has been designed and administered and the responses received have been analysed using SPSS software. General descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviation along with paired t-test and Pearson's correlation studies have been employed for analysing the importance of the measures of productivity. A user driven PDM evaluation framework and methodology based on the two stage Quality Function Deployment (QFD) technique has been developed to select the most suitable PDM product for a specific industry. A simple model to measure the Return on Investment for PDM implemented industries based on Port and Mackrell's [24] work has been developed. Thus, methodologies have been developed and demonstrated with case studies to overcome the issues identified in the survey.

However, new capabilities in networked cyber-physical systems demand more complex infrastructure and algorithms and often lead to new security flaws and operational risks that increase the attack surface area exponentially. The interconnected nature of Industry 4.0-driven operations and the pace of digital transformation mean that cyberattacks can have far more extensive effects than ever before. Based on that, the core ideas of this paper are driven by the observation that cybersecurity is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0. Having this in mind, we propose CryptoFactory - a forward-looking design of a layered-based architecture that can be used as a starting point for building secure and privacy-preserving smart factories. CryptoFactory aims to change the security outlook in smart manufacturing by discussing a set of fundamental requirements and functionality that modern factories should support in order to be resistant to both internal and external attacks. To this end, CryptoFactory first focuses on how to build trust relationships between the hardware devices in the factory. Then, we look on how to use several cryptographic approaches to allow IoT devices to securely collect, store and share their data while we also touch upon the emerging topic of secure and privacy-preserving communication and collaboration between manufacturing environments and value chains.

One primary PUF application is the secure derivation of volatile cryptographic keys using a fuzzy extractor (FE) comprising: 1) a secure sketch and 2) an entropy extractor. Although the entropy extractor can be lightweight, the overhead of the secure sketch responsible for correcting naturally noisy PUF responses is usually high. We observe that, in general, response unreliability with respect to an enrolled reference measurement increases with increasing differences between the in-the-field PUF operating condition and the operating condition used in evaluating the enrolled reference response. For the first time, we exploit such an inadvertent but important observation. In contrast to the conventional single reference response enrollment, we propose enrolling multiple reference responses (MRRs) subject to the same challenge but under multiple distinct operating conditions. The critical observation here is that one of the reference operating conditions is likely to be closer to the operating condition of the field deployed PUF, thus resulting in minimizing the expected unreliability when compared to the single reference under the nominal condition. As a consequence, MRR greatly reduces the demand for the expected number of erroneous bits requiring correction and, subsequently, achieves a significant reduction in the error correction overhead. The significant implementation efficiency gains from the proposed MRR method are demonstrated from software implementations of FEs on batteryless resource constraint computational radio frequency identification devices, where realistic PUF data are collected from intrinsic static random access memory PUFs. © 2018 IEEE.;"computational radio frequency identification; fuzzy extractor; key generation; lightweight authentication; Physical unclonable functions; reverse fuzzy extractor";"Entropy; Hardware security; Public key cryptography; Radio waves; Fuzzy extractors; Key generation; Multiple references; Physical unclonable functions (PUF); Radio frequency identification devices; Reference measurements; Resource Constraint; Software implementation; Radio frequency identification (RFID)";Article;Scopus

IIoT integrates a large number of sensors for smart and connected monitoring of machine conditions. Sensor observations contain rich information on operational signatures of machines, thereby providing a great opportunity for machine condition monitoring and control. However, realizing the full potential of IIoT depends to a great extent on the development of new methodologies using big data analytics. This paper presents a new methodology for large-scale IIoT machine information processing, network modeling, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis. First, we introduce a dynamic warping algorithm to characterize the dissimilarity of machine signatures (e.g., power profiles during operations). Second, we develop a stochastic network embedding algorithm to construct a large-scale network of IIoT machines, in which the dissimilarity between machine signatures is preserved in the network node-to-node distance. When the machine condition varies, the location of the corresponding network node changes accordingly. As such, node locations will reveal diagnostic information about machine conditions. However, the network embedding algorithm is computationally expensive in the presence of large amounts of IIoT-enabled machines. Therefore, we further develop a parallel computing scheme that harnesses the power of multiple processors for efficient network modeling of large-scale IIoT-enabled machines. Experimental results show that the developed algorithm efficiently and effectively characterizes the variations of signatures in both cycle-to-cycle and machine-to-machine scales. This new approach shows strong potentials for optimal machine scheduling and maintenance in the context of large-scale IIoT. © 2018 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers;"Big data analytics; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Large-scale network; Machine condition monitoring; Parallel computing; Power consumption";"Big data; Cryptography; Electric power utilization; Fault detection; Green computing; Internet of things; Parallel processing systems; Stochastic systems; Big Data Analytics; Dynamic warping algorithm; Industrial internets; Large-scale network; Machine condition monitoring; Machine to machines; Operational signatures; Parallel com- puting; Condition monitoring";Article;Scopus

These patterns represent the inherent texture of paper, formed by the random interleaving of wooden particles during the manufacturing process. We show that these patterns can be easily captured by a commodity camera and condensed into a compact 2,048-bit fingerprint code. Prominent works in this area (Nature 2005, IEEE S&P 2009, CCS 2011) have all focused on fingerprinting paper based on the paper ""surface."" We are motivated by the observation that capturing the surface alone misses important distinctive features such as the noneven thickness, random distribution of impurities, and different materials in the paper with varying opacities. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the embedded paper texture provides a more reliable source for fingerprinting than features on the surface. Based on the collected datasets, we achieve 0% false rejection and 0% false acceptance rates. We further report that our extracted fingerprints contain 807 degrees of freedom (DoF), which is much higher than the 249 DoF with iris codes (that have the same size of 2,048 bits). The high amount of DoF for texturebased fingerprints makes our method extremely scalable for recognition among very large databases; it also allows secure usage of the extracted fingerprint in privacy-preserving authentication schemes based on error correction techniques. © 2017 ACM.";"Biometrics; Counterfeiting; Paper fingerprint; Physical unclonable function";"Biometrics; Cryptography; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Error correction; Hardware security; Impurities; Light sources; Correction techniques; Counterfeiting; False acceptance rate; Fingerprinting techniques; Manufacturing process; Privacy-preserving authentication; Random distribution; Very large database; Data privacy";Article;Scopus

In this paper we focus on SRAM-PUFs. The SRAM-PUFs enjoy uniqueness and randomness properties stemming from the intrinsic randomness of SRAM memory cells, which is a result of manufacturing variations. This randomness can be translated into the cryptographic keys thus avoiding the need to store and manage the device cryptographic keys. Therefore these properties, combined with the fact that SRAM memory can be often found in today's IoT devices, make SRAM-PUFs a promising candidate for securing and authentication of the resource-constrained IoT devices. PUF observations are always affected by noise and environmental changes. Therefore secret-generation schemes with helper data are used to guarantee reliable regeneration of the PUF-based secret keys. Error correction codes (ECCs) are an essential part of these schemes. In this work, we propose a practical error correction construction for PUF-based secret generation that are based on polar codes. The resulting scheme can generate 128-bit keys using 1024 SRAM-PUF bits and 896 helper data bits and achieve a failure probability of 10-9 or lower for a practical SRAM-PUFs setting with bit error probability of 15%. The method is based on successive cancellation combined with list decoding and hash-based checking that makes use of the hash that is already available at the decoder. In addition, an adaptive list decoder for polar codes is investigated. This decoder increases the list size only if needed. © 2017 IEEE.;;"Authentication; Bit error rate; Decoding; Error correction; Internet of things; Public key cryptography; Random processes; Bit error probability; Device authentications; Environmental change; Error correction codes (ECCs); Intrinsic randomness; Manufacturing Variation; Secret key generations; Successive cancellation; Static random access storage";Conference Paper;Scopus

Unfortunately, the hardware implementation of these cryptographic algorithms allows secret key retrieval using different forms of attacks based on the observation of key-related information. Dedicated design for security techniques have been proposed so far, ranging from the development of specific cell libraries to the implementation of extra functions to prevent leakage of useful information and key identification. On the other hand, one can expect high-quality product for secure applications and this expectation requires the development of test solutions for every component of the secure device. However, testing those devices faces a double dilemma: (i) test and, possibly, develop DfT schemes providing high testability, i.e., high signal controllability/observability, while maintaining high security, i.e., without leakage of sensitive information; (ii) provide high security using dedicated design rules while maintaining high testability. This chapter addresses these issues, discusses pros and cons of security-dedicated DfT from both a design and a testability point of view. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.";;"Cryptography; Hardware; Communication medium; Cryptographic algorithms; Hardware implementations; High-quality products; Key identifications; Manufacturing testing; Security countermeasures; Sensitive informations; Hardware security";Book Chapter;Scopus

PUF designs rely on manufacturing process variations to produce unique response to input challenges. It has been shown that many PUF designs are vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks, where a model can be built to predict PUF response to any input after only a few observations. In this work, we propose a ML attack resistant PUF design based on a circuit block to implement a non-linear voltage transfer function. The proposed circuit is simple, exhibits high uniqueness and randomness. Further improvements are proposed to enhance PUF reliability. The proposed circuit was simulated in a 45nm technology process and the results indicate a significant improvement in ML attack resistance in comparison to traditional PUFs.

Businesses that put customers in control of their online privacy options increase consumer faith in the online world - and promote greater acceptance of e-commerce. Ultimately, though, the issue comes down to consumer empowerment and trust. ""Companies rolling out RFID must have a clear and rigidly enforced policy on the deactivation of their tracking mechanisms, as having a cost-effective supply chain will be pretty meaningless if nobody trusts you enough to buy from you,"" states Martin Butler. RFID is rapidly pushed to the existing markets with diversified applications, such as automatic tariffs payment in public transport, animal identification and tracking, and automated manufacturing and logistics control. Unprotected communications between tags and readers over a wireless channel can disclose information about the tags and their positions. Due to the potential wide deployment of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), the security of RFID systems has drawn extensive attention from both academia and industry, and the RFID authentication protocol is an important mechanism in the security of RFID systems. The desired security requirements of RFID authentication protocols include privacy, integrity, authentication, anonymity/untraceability, and even availability. To design an efficient protocol that satisfies all the requirements with limited resources is a challenge According to Benoit Calmels et.al - 2006 -Strong cryptography mechanisms need high computing resources which is not possible to be embedded into RFID tags. The approach would be an implementation of some low-cost but secure cryptographic functions in the tag. It would bring a high level of privacy where there is no need for any substantial change in the synopsis of communication between the tag and the reader. On the other hand, the tag broadcasts the same data to any reader, with dependency on given authorization, could read and process all or part of the said data. The major challenge faced when trying to provide security for low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in their very limited resources - for example, tag memory will be restricted to several hundred bits, and approximately 250-4000 logic gates out of the total tag space can be devoted to security-related tasks. So readers should bear in mind that these constrained devices are unable to support on-chip standard cryptographic primitives. During this research with an exploratory purpose some different protocols around authentication and cryptography in low cost RFID would be investigated and compared as the output and result with a qualitative approach. This strategy makes the opportunity to discover similarities and differences among protocols and solutions. So that specialists or executives who are looking for a proper protocol or scheme correspondent to their needs or priorities, could choose one or two among others, in other words when investigating the varied types of attacks against schemes, the administrator or the customer of the technology (technology buyer) could set up a comparison to find the suitable protocol according to his/her criterions or priorities like the value of data that is going to be transmitted by RFID transceivers in the air field or wireless media, or the probable attacks could happen according to situation of located RFID devices. For example, if the administrator or executive knows that the position or location that his/her RFID devices located are vulnerable to DOS attack would not choose RHLK or LCAP as the appropriate protocol, or if he/she assumes that spoofing or replay attack is more probable than other attacks then would not choose Li et al. or SRAC schemes for his/ her RFID transceivers authentication. © 2010 IEEE.";"Authentication; Cryptography; Lightweight; Low cost RFID";"Animal identification; Automated Manufacturing; Computing resource; Constrained devices; Consumer empowerment; Cryptographic functions; Cryptographic primitives; Different protocols; DoS attacks; E-Commerce; In-control; Light-weight cryptography; Lightweight; Logistics control; Low costs; On chips; Online privacy; Public transport; Qualitative approach; Radiofrequency identification tags; Replay attack; RF-ID tags; RFID authentication; RFID systems; Security requirements; Tracking mechanism; Wireless channel; Wireless media; Authentication; Computer crime; Costs; Cryptography; Electronic commerce; Network protocols; Network security; Radio navigation; Radio waves; Sales; Supply chains; Technology; Transceivers; Radio frequency identification (RFID)";Conference Paper;Scopus

Ransomware, a variant of malware, encrypts files, data, and often locks computer systems, and retains the decryption key until victims pay a ransom. Current method of ransomware mitigation is the analysis and classification of the ransomware and its variants to propose solution for detection and prevention. This mitigation approach omits technology users as part of the solution especially given their role in falling prey to ransomware by means of social engineering attack vectors. The purpose of this qualitative study was to highlight current and emerging ransomware vectors, and to identify cyber security awareness and education solutions that can be applied to mitigate socially engineered ransomware attacks. A semi-structured interview with executives and managers from several financial, technology, construction, transportation, education, and health industries revealed the lack of current awareness and training approaches to mitigate against socially engineered ransomware attacks. This study recommends some specific cybersecurity training and awareness approaches to consider in order to enable technology users resist and mitigate against ransomware attacks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.;"Cybersecurity; Malware; Mitigation; Ransomware; Social engineering";"Cryptography; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Network security; Personnel training; Attack vector; Cyber security; Health industry; Qualitative study; Semi structured interviews; Social engineering; Malware";Conference Paper;Scopus

In this study we characterize this problem by looking at a cohort of South African students. We employ a web-based survey of 100 students, supplemented by in-depth interviews with 10 additional students. In both cases we inquired about, and observed knowledge of permissions, encryption and application installation practices. Our findings show that most students (80%) do not look for or understand permissions or encryption, and use location-based services unsafely. Based on these results we argue that digital natives lack the technical skills and understanding to properly engage with mobile privacy and security. We further argue that this generation has been so over-exposed to mobile requests that violate their privacy and security that they have become desensitized and their definition of privacy and security has changed. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for higher education institutions, policy, and mobile application design. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The results showed that multiple representations were helpful for students to comprehend a concept because the different representations supported each other and provided more comprehensive information. In addition, students who are not fluent in translating one representation to another perform poorer than students who are more capable in representational fluency. While students have their own favorite representations, math representation seems dominate the outcome of their performance. This may suggest that students who will be working on the technical side of the cyberse-curity should better prepare their math skills. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;"Cryptography Education; Eye Tracking; MEA; Representational Fluency";"Cryptography; Eye tracking; Cognitive process; Comprehensive information; Eye-tracking studies; Math skills; Multiple representation; Representational Fluency; Students";Conference Paper;Scopus

Potential attackers are recognising this and the last two years have seen a huge increase in cyber-attacks within the sector. Attempts at addressing the increasing threats have taken the form of technical solutions such as encryption, access control, CCTV, etc. However, a high majority of security breaches can be directly attributed to human error. It is therefore necessary that measures for addressing the rising trend of cyber-attacks go beyond just providing technical solutions and make provision for educating employees about how to address the human elements of security. Inculcating security awareness amongst hospitality employees will provide a foundation upon which a culture of security can be created to promote the seamless and secured interaction of hotel users and technology. One way that the hospitality industry has tried to solve the awareness issue is through their current paper-based training. This is unengaging, expensive and presents limited ways to deploy, monitor and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the content. This leads to cycles of constant training, making it very hard to initiate awareness, particularly within those on minimum waged, short-term job roles.This paper presents a structured approach for eliciting industry requirement for developing and implementing an immersive Cyber Security Awareness learning platform. It used a series of over 40 interviews and threat analysis of the hospitality industry to identify the requirements for designing and implementing cyber security program which encourage engagement through a cycle of reward and recognition. In particular, the need for the use of gamification elements to provide an engaging but gentle way of educating those with little or no desire to learn was identified and implemented. Also presented is a method for guiding and monitoring the impact of their employee's progress through the learning management system whilst monitoring the levels of engagement and positive impact the training is having on the business. © 2017 IEEE.;"Cyber security awareness; E-learning; Gamification; Hospitality; Human factor; Systematic requirement engineering";"Access control; Computer crime; Crime; Cryptography; E-learning; Education; Human engineering; Network security; Requirements engineering; Cyber security; Gamification; Hospitality; Hospitality industry; Industry requirements; Learning management system; Requirement engineering; Technical solutions; Personnel training";Conference Paper;Scopus

In Ethernet, the common vulnerabilities come from Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). It is critical for students to learn these vulnerabilities, understand the mechanisms of exploits, and know the countermeasures, which include static ARP cache entries, improved ARP module in operating systems, encryption, intrusion detection, and data backup. In this paper, we introduce a hands-on lab to help students learn how ARP spoofing attack works. The objective of this lab is to let students successfully become a Man-In-The-Middle by manually creating attack packets. Although tools exist that carry out ARP spoofing attack automatically, asking students to create raw ARP spoofing packets themselves can help them understand the mechanisms of this attack method much deeper than with the automatic tools. We have studied the effectiveness of this lab on the students' understanding of LAN vulnerabilities. Tests were conducted to measure the performance of students before and after using this tool. We gave students surveys after they completed the hands-on lab. A few students were selected for an interview by an independent evaluator. The result shows that this tool can help students understand the concept of ARP spoofing attacks and motivate them in learning more about cyber security. © 2016 IEEE.;"ARP spoofing; Computer science; Course module; Cyber security; Hands-on lab; Local area network; Man-in-the-middle";"Computer science; Cryptography; Education; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Laboratories; Local area networks; Teaching; ARP Spoofing; Course modules; Cyber security; Hands-on lab; Man in the middle; Students";Conference Paper;Scopus

We used principles drawn from research and theories in disciplines such as cognitive science, motivation, and education to design the tutorials. They were developed as part of the OpenDSA eTextbook project (http://algoviz. org/OpenDSA), an open source, online system combining textbook-quality content with algorithm visualizations and interactive exercises. DSA courses emphasize dynamic processes such as how various algorithms work. OpenDSA supports presenting such content in a highly visual manner through the frequent use of slideshows, simulations, and visualizations. Students were also provided a continuous stream of automated assessment questions and interactive exercises, thus providing immediate feedback to the students on their progress. A pilot study was conducted with students in a Computer Science course at Virginia Tech during Fall 2012. We tested three weeks of content on sorting and hashing in a quasi-experimental setting and collected quantitative and qualitative data. The data consisted of students' performance as measured by their grades, students' perceptions and opinions obtained on surveys, field notes from observing the classes, interview data at the end of the course, and the interaction logs that our system records. After the pilot test, students' average grade in the treatment group was slightly (but not significantly) better than the control group on the post test. Students' survey and interview data indicated positive feedback about OpenDSA, with the average response on how well they liked using the OpenDSA materials increasing after use as compared to a similar pretest question about whether they would like to use such materials. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.;;"Algorithm visualization; Automated assessment; Cognitive science; Computer Science course; Immediate feedbacks; Interactive exercise; Online tutorials; Qualitative data; Algorithms; Cryptography; Data structures; Engineering education; Feedback; Open systems; Students; Surveys; Teaching";Conference Paper;Scopus

Thus, security mechanisms are used as a measure to ensure safety and to implement the security services for the text documents, audio, video and other types of data communication over the network. These security mechanisms are helpful to recognise, prevent and recover from security breaches, threats and attacks. Some of the security mechanisms are Cryptography, Public key certification, Authentication, Digital signatures etc. Obviously, these are mostly used by educated people in communication for their data to be remain integrated, confidential and safe. But, a bitter fact is that there are 30.90% people who are illiterate and have no education background living in our country and their data is also very important to them. So, we have to connect those illiterate people to these security mechanisms, so that they can also communicate without being in fear of the data loss or data manipulation. There are many ways to connect illiterate people with the security mechanisms such as by using facial recognition and fingerprint as the password in various systems or machines like ATMs, banks, government offices and also provide information and knowledge about the prevention from the possible fraud, theft and malicious activities. This paper discuss those different ways to connect the illiterate people with security mechanisms and enlighten their lives. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;"Cryptography; Digital signature; Literacy; Security mechanism; Socio-technical";"Authentication; Crime; Digital communication systems; Face recognition; Data manipulations; Data-communication; Digital communications; Facial recognition; Illiterate peoples; Malicious activities; Security mechanism; Threats and attacks; Network security";Conference Paper;Scopus

Encryption offers an interesting case study for the application of visualisation, largely due to its complex and abstract nature. This paper is concerned with the presentation of a dynamic and interactive visualisation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, and the evaluation of its educational value. Its design was motivated by the desire to seamlessly bridge the gap between algorithm formulation and its visualisation, and to provide instruction in context. As DES is an archetypal cryptographic algorithm, a visualisation of its operations on confusion and diffusion is a key requirement. The educational value of the visualisation is expressed in terms of four facets: its educational effectiveness, its presentation as an interactive and dynamic graphical object, its perceived usefulness by students and its completeness as a learning resource. Educational effectiveness was assessed in terms of the pre-test and post-test scores of a treatment group and a control group of students, whereas the other three facets were evaluated through a survey taken by the treatment group. An analysis of the results of the evaluation of the visualisation confirms its educational value. © 2020 ACM.;"Animation; Empirical evaluation; Encryption; Instruction";"Cryptography; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Speed control; Visualization; Cryptographic algorithms; Data encryption standard; Educational effectiveness; Graphical objects; Interactive visualisation; Learning resource; Perceived usefulness; Treatment group; Students";Conference Paper;Scopus

Wheels, Compass, calendar and pozzolana are some of the remarkable inventions in before Christ (B.C) period. Clock, printing press, steam engines, vaccines, electricity, mechanical computer, telegraph, iron and steel, aero plane, transistors, ARPANET, personal computer and Internet are few outstanding innovations fuelled our world for last four centuries. If we look at the time line of inventions, it is dramatically reduced over the advancement of time. Inventions took centuries in B.C, but needs only a few years or a decade in A.D. We would like to add the blockchain technology in this line up, which could fuel new era of inventions in new dimensions. This technology relies on decentralized concepts, entirely against the present centralized system, the world relies on. Why we still need a third party book keepers or why we still need an third party intermediary for trust and transactions? This article will answer these arguments. This article begins with the conceptual understanding, then reveals its disruptiveness through several case studies across several industries such as Banking, Administration, Supply chain management, Logistics, Asset management, Intellectual property management, Transport and Energy. Blockchain technology has the potential to redefine every one another technology of human beings. Concept of ledger and its evolution, from its voyage from Indian origin single entry ledger to Satoshi Nakamoto?s triple entry ledger has been highlighted, as these are vital to understand the technology behind bit coin. Without mentioning the crypto currencies, the blockchain use cases will not ended up, hence few excerpts of crypto currencies also added. From cryptography in technology, Anti money laundering, Know your customer, Transaction monitoring in Banking to day to day administration as in the case of land records storage, identity management etc., are few contributions of this article. We also covered the case studies from corporate giants such as Amazon, IBM, MAERSK to the startups like EzyRemit, Signzy etc., and from an individual state of administration Andrapradesh to the entire country, Dubai. It is important for the global engineering education needs to identify and nurture the disruptive technologies, which could contribute to our society in meaningful way. We believe that, blockchain technology belongs to the category of future technologies, which could shape up and fuel the development of global economy for next few decades as internet did for past few decades. Through this article, the young generation engineering pupils, matured practitioners and influential decision makers will understand the potential of blockchain technology and provide impetus to global engineering education. © 2020 The Authors.

However, heterogeneity and privacy make it more challenging to collect and process multi-source healthcare data in a real time manner. To support healthcare monitoring, in this research, a multi-layer edge computing-based framework is designed to detect emergencies in low latency and secure ways. First, a universal data model is defined to process heterogeneous data from multi-sources such as sensors or smart devices. Then, Gated Recurrent Units-based (GRU) model is utilized to capture and process physiological data series. Fine-grained detection models are built and distinguished according to scenario information and individual health persona. In the proposed edge computing-based framework, detection algorithm computation and physiological index data storage are close to end user sides to support low latency. Meanwhile encryption algorithm is used to protect data privacy. Finally, a case study in the Physical Education Class scenario is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of our methods. The experimental result shows that our GRU model is more accurate and is three times faster for emergency identification compared with Support Vector Classification model. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;;"Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Edge computing; Health care; Physiological models; Physiology; Detection algorithm; Emergency detection; Encryption algorithms; Healthcare monitoring; Physical education; Physiological indices; Support vector classification; Universal data model; Monitoring";Article;Scopus

To produce secure software, security activities need to be integrated throughout the software development lifecycle. One such activity is security design analysis (SDA), which identifies security requirements as early as the software design phase. While considered an important step in software development, the general opinion of information security subject matter experts and researchers is that SDA is challenging to learn and teach. Experimental evidence provided in literature confirms this claim. To help solve this, we have developed a framework for teaching SDA by utilizing case study analysis and the hybrid flipped classroom approach. We evaluate our framework by performing a comparative analysis between a group of students who attended labs generated using our framework and a group that participated in traditional labs. Our results show that labs created using our framework achieve better learning outcomes for SDA, as opposed to the traditional labs. Secondary contributions of our article include teaching materials, such as lab descriptions and a case study of a hospital information system to be used for SDA. We outline instructions for using our framework in different contexts, including university courses and corporate training programs. By using our proposed teaching framework, with our or any other case study, we believe that both students and employees can learn the craft of SDA more effectively. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.;"Architectural risk analysis; Cybersecurity education; Risk assessment; Security development lifecycle; Security requirements; Security-oriented curriculum; Threat modeling";"Cryptography; Laboratories; Life cycle; Personnel training; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security of data; Corporate training programs; Cyber-security educations; Hospital information systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Security development lifecycle; Security requirements; Software development life cycle; Threat modeling; Software design";Article;Scopus

Indian Government in broad and its States and Union Territories are trying harder for Smart Governance with Digital India movement taking IT/ICT as a tool. At one hand when Government is trying for delivering various e-Governance services to its citizen through portals and Web-based Applications Cyber Security has become the biggest challenge. The word security was coined to ensure protection to some object, the term gradually evolved to secure our information and data from providing security to objects and individuals. Security is very much essential in our daily life. A new term along with security is coined known as insurance. Individuals believe in securing there objects. But nowadays every individual is more conscious about security to protect their data and information in the cyber world. The use of internet revolves around many fields like education, e-commerce, hospitals, companies, military purposes and many more. Therefore, it is very important to keep our data safe and avoid use by unauthentic users. India is digitally divided into four regions east, west, north and south. Though India is progressing rapidly in digital world in International scenario, in reality the eastern part of India is less digitally active. In this paper we have given a case study how International Hackers are trying to target eastern part of India with Odisha State as a case. We have also taken how the State and Central Government have taken initiation to prevent data hacking, cyber attacks and recovery of data. Finally, the paper is concluded by citing the efficiency of some of the methods for retrieval of data from the theft. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.;"Confidentiality; Cyber attack; Cyber security; Data deduplication; Data manipulation; Data mirroring; Data security; Encryption; Integrity";"Crime; Cryptography; Developing countries; Government data processing; Intelligent computing; Network security; Personal computing; Security of data; Confidentiality; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Data de duplications; Data manipulations; Data mirroring; Integrity; Computer crime";Conference Paper;Scopus

Unfortunately, these rules are so general as to be of little help when it comes to actually designing an assignment, and then varying it from one course offering to the next. This paper uses a case study, a programming assignment in cryptography, to propose specific guidelines that can be applied to the design of programming assignments to reduce the chance that students will be able to copy from students in prior offerings of the course, and to reduce the chance that students will be able to copy from programs found on the web. The guidelines illustrated by the case study are to begin with something basic, to add hidden complexity, to add manifest complexity, to add levels of complexity, to vary the assignment substantially in each successive offering, and to have multiple test plans. © 2017 ACM.;"Academic integrity; Cheating; Computing education; Cryptography; Programming assignments";"Cryptography; Curricula; Education; Academic integrity; Cheating; Computing education; Multiple test; Programming assignments; Writing assignments; Students";Conference Paper;Scopus

Students have expressed negative opinions about electronic examinations (e-examinations) due to a fear of, or unfamiliarity with, the technology of assessment, and a lack of knowledge about the methods of e-examinations. Background Electronic examinations are now a viable alternative method of assessing stu-dent learning. They provide freedom of choice, in terms of the location of the examination, and can provide immediate feedback; students and institutions can be assured of the integrity of knowledge testing. This in turn motivates stu-dents to strive for deeper learning and better results, in a higher quality and more rigorous educational process. Methodology This paper compares an e-examination system at FUT Minna Nigeria with one in Australia, at the University of Tasmania, using case study analysis. The func-tions supported, or inhibited, by each of the two e-examination systems, with different approaches to question types, cohort size, technology used, and securi-ty features, are compared. Contribution The researchers' aim is to assist stakeholders (including lecturers, invigilators, candidates, computer instructors, and server operators) to identify ways of im-proving the process. The relative convenience for students, administrators, and lecturer/assessors and the reliability and security of the two systems are consid-ered. Challenges in conducting e-examinations in both countries are revealed by juxtaposing the systems. The authors propose ways of developing more effec-tive e-examination systems. Findings The comparison of the two institutions in Nigeria and Australia shows e-examinations have been implemented for the purpose of selecting students for university courses, and for their assessment once enrolled. In Nigeria, there is widespread systemic adoption for university entrance merit selection. In Aus-tralia this has been limited to one subject in one state, rather than being adopted nationally. Within undergraduate courses, the Nigerian scenario is quite exten-sive; in Australia this adoption has been slower, but has penetrated a wide varie-ty of disciplines. Recommendations for Practitioners Assessment integrity and equipment reliability were common issues across the two case studies, although the delivery of e-examinations is different in each country. As with any procedural process, a particular solution is only as good as its weakest attribute. Technical differences highlight the link between e-examination system approaches and pedagogical implications. It is clear that social, cultural, and environmental factors affect the success of e-examinations. For example, an interrupted electrical power supply and limited technical know-how are two of the challenges affecting the conduct of e-examinations in Nige-ria. In Tasmania, the challenge with the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) is to make the system operate on an increasing variety of user equipment, including tablets. Recommendation for Researchers The comparisons between the two universities indicate there will be a produc-tive convergence of the approaches in future. One key proposal, which arose from the analysis of the existing e-examination systems in Nigeria and Australia, is to design a form of ""live"" operating system that is deployable over the Inter-net. This method would use public key cryptography for lecturers to encrypt their questions online. Impact on Society If institutions are to transition to e-examinations, one way of facilitating this move is by using computers to imitate other assessment techniques. However, higher order thinking is usually demonstrated through open-ended or creative tasks. In this respect the Australian system shows promise by providing the same full operating system and software application suite to all candidates, thereby supporting assessment of such creative higher order thinking. The two cases illustrate the potential tension between ""online"" or networked reticulation of questions and answers, as opposed to ""offline"" methods. Future Research A future design proposition is a web-based strategy for a virtual machine, which is launched into candidates' computers at the start of each e-examination. The new system is a form of BYOD externally booted e-examination (as in Austral-ia) that is deployable over the Internet with encryption and decryption features using public key cryptography (Nigeria). This will allow lecturers to encrypt their questions and post them online while the questions are decrypted by the administrator or students are given the key.

Devising automated tools and techniques to assist and speed up the analysis process remains a major endeavor in computer security. While manual intervention will likely remain a key ingredient in the short and mid term, the recent advances in static and dynamic analysis techniques have the potential to significantly impact the malware analysis practice. In this paper we show how an analyst can use symbolic execution techniques to unveil critical behavior of a remote access trojan (RAT). Using a tool we implemented in the Angr framework, we analyze a sample drawn from a well-known RAT family that leverages thread injection vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Win32 API. Our case study shows how to automatically derive the list of commands supported by the RAT and the sequence of system calls that are activated for each of them, systematically exploring the stealthy communication protocol with the server and yielding clues to potential threats that may pass unnoticed by a manual inspection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;"ANGR; APT; Malware; RAT; Symbolic execution";"Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Cryptography; Education; Learning systems; Model checking; Rating; Rats; Security of data; ANGR; Critical behavior; Manual inspection; Manual intervention; Potential threats; Remote access trojans; Static and dynamic analysis; Symbolic execution; Malware";Conference Paper;Scopus

However, the increased use of biometrics (such as faces) triggered a lot of research on the protection biometric data in the fields of computer security and cryptography. Unfortunately, most of the face-based systems, and most notably the privacy-preserving mechanisms, are evaluated on small data sets or assume ideal distributions of the faces (that could differ significantly from the real data). At the same time, acquiring large biometric data sets for evaluation purposes is time consuming, expensive, and complicated due to legal/ethical considerations related to the privacy of the test subjects. In this work, we present GenFace, the first publicly available system for generating synthetic facial images. GenFace can generate sets of large number of facial images, solving the aforementioned problem. Such sets can be used for testing and evaluating face-based authentication systems. Such test sets can also be used in balancing the ROC curves of such systems with the error correction codes used in authentication systems employing secure sketch or fuzzy extractors. Another application is the use of these test sets in the evaluation of privacy-preserving biometric protocols such as GSHADE, which can now enjoy a large number of synthetic examples which follow a real-life distribution of biometrics. As a case study, we show how to use GenFace in evaluating SecureFace, a face-based authentication system that offers end-to-end authentication and privacy. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;"Biometrics; Face verification; Face-based authentication; GenFace; SecureFace; Synthetic face generation";"Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Biometrics; Cryptography; Data privacy; Education; Error correction; Learning systems; Security of data; Authentication systems; Error correction codes; Face recognition technologies; Face Verification; GenFace; Privacy preserving; SecureFace; Synthetic faces; Face recognition";Conference Paper;Scopus

We illustrate it to quantify the security of an e-Learning application while taking account of its respective stakeholders, security requirements, architectural components and the complete list of security threats. Moreover, in the mean time, security requirements are considered as appropriate mechanisms for preventing, detecting and recovering security attacks, for this reason an extension of the MFC measure is presented in order to detect the most critical security requirements to support the quantitative decision-making. Our focus is widespread to offer a diagnostic of the non secure system's problems and a depth insight interpretation about critical requirements, critical threats and critical components. This extension is beneficial and opens a wide range of possibilities for further economics based analysis. Also this chapter highlights the security measures for controlling e-Learning security problems regarding the most critical security requirements. © 2015, IGI Global.

Such evaluations in Greece are being conducted for many years in higher education institutes based on traditional print questionnaires handed-out to students at the lecture room. Compared to traditional paper-based questionnaires, the introduction of electronic student evaluation procedures has a number of advantages that merit consideration. a) it allows the students to evaluate courses from their home at their ease and beyond privacy breaches (e.g. by avoiding his/her fellow student looking at his/her answers), b) results are automatically archived in electronic format allowing fast further processing for the extraction of useful information, and c) it offers the possibility of using strong cryptographic tools to ensure student anonymity and data confidentiality. In this report we describe a pilot system that is being developed by the Computer Technology Institute & Press - Diophantus (CTI) within the context of the project ABC4Trust. The projects main goal is the development of a reference implementation of a privacy preserving eIdentity management framework based on the cryptographic primitives called Attribute Based Credentials. The pilot system will offer to a group of selected students the possibility of evaluating courses they have taken from their homes through the Internet and provide their feedback proving their eligibility to participate in the evaluation while, at the same time, preserving their anonymity. In this paper we describe the architecture and main scenarios of the pilot. CTIs long term vision is to use the pilot as a small scale proof of concept of privacy enhancement technologies in the eParticipation domain in order to introduce, in the future, of these technologies to the educational communities of all levels in Greece. These technologies will be the vehicle for supporting privacy preserving eParticipation in discussion groups whereby participants will provide their opinion anonymously but after proving that they are eligible to participate in group discussions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.;;"Cryptography; Curricula; Surveys; Cryptographic primitives; Educational community; Educational institutions; Enhancement technologies; Greek higher education; Management frameworks; Reference implementation; Teaching methodologies; Students";Conference Paper;Scopus

Validating whether encryption algorithms are correctly implemented is a challenging issue. Software testing delivers an effective and practical solution, but it also faces the oracle problem (that is, under many practical situations, it is impossible or too computationally expensive to know whether the output for any given input is correct). In this paper, we propose a property-based approach to testing encryption programs in the absence of oracles. Our approach makes use of the so-called metamorphic properties of encryption algorithms to generate test cases and verify test results. Two case studies were conducted to illustrate the proposed approach and validate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that even without oracles, the proposed approach can detect nearly 50% inserted faults with at most three metamorphic relations (MRs) and fifty test cases. © 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"encryption programs; metamorphic testing (MT); software testing; test oracles";"Algorithms; Software testing; Encryption algorithms; Metamorphic relations; Metamorphic testing; Oracle problem; Practical solutions; Property-based; Property-based testing; Test oracles; Cryptography";Article;Scopus

The use of web services to provide security in e-learning systems will complement the features of services developed in language and/or different architectures. Thus, our work is not limited to platforms in which the client (e-learning system) was developed, since this service is provided on a flexible, scalable and configurable way. The proposed service uses public key cryptography, digital signature and secret key cryptography to provide integrity, nonrepudiation, confidentiality and authenticity. The main features of the proposed service are presented in this paper, with their employability in a case study for the chat tool for collaborative learning environments, Sakai and Moodle. The completion of the case study is a contribution to the environments above, since the chat tool in these systems does not have security services.

The literature on organizational learning, however, has tended to focus on aspects of knowledge that are pertinent at the macro-organizational level (i.e. the overall business). The authors attempt in this paper to address a relative void in the literature, aiming to demonstrate the inter-locking factors within an enterprise information system that relate knowledge management and organizational learning, via a model that highlights key factors within such an inter-relationship. This is achieved by extrapolating data from a manufacturing organization using a case study, with these data then modeled using a cognitive mapping technique (fuzzy cognitive mapping, FCM). The empirical enquiry explores an interpretivist view of knowledge, within an information systems evaluation (ISE) process, through the associated classification of structural, interpretive and evaluative knowledge. This is achieved by visualizing inter-relationships within the ISE decision-making approach in the case organization. A number of decision paths within the cognitive map are then identified such that a greater understanding of ISE can be sought. The authors therefore present a model that defines a relationship between knowledge management (KM) and organizational learning (OL), and highlights factors that can lead a firm to develop itself towards a learning organization. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this new European context, it is required not only theoretical concepts, but also a learning methodology where professors have a secondary role and students are the main actors of the learning process. We present a proposal of adaptation for a subject of cryptography, which combines a short theoretical review of basics concepts and a set of practical exercises. These exercises are designed with the aim to achieve a global perspective of developing cryptographic systems. A modular approach was selected in order that every new design required results generated in the previous one. A case study of an implementation of a hash function is presented. This exercise demands some skills related with different subjects of their curricula to develop a fully functional system, focusing the learning on a project-based design. © IEEE.;"Bologna declaration; Cryptography; Education; Learning by competencies";"Bologna declaration; Cryptographic systems; European context; European Higher Education Area; Functional systems; Global perspective; Learning by competencies; Learning process; Modular approach; New design; Project-based; Teaching methodologies; Curricula; Hash functions; Teaching";Article;Scopus

The ultimate objective of this model is to provide a high level human resource that would satisfy the performance demands. Moreover, the key features of Iran regarding its higher education include: education-wise human development; major employers and employment possibilities; universities; and the country's technological capacity.

Politically NEIS was installed and managed in each provincial Office of Education so that huge amount of students' personal information is stored in central integrated NEIS database system. But Korea Teachers' Union and some of civilian groups have raised a possibility of infringement on student's privacy. Education Informatization Committee, as an advisory organization, proposed separation of school administration section from NEIS as of March 2004 to resolve the conflicts between Government and Teachers Union. SAMS was originated in separated school administration. When the SAMS project was started, use of domestic S/W industries are encouraged and guided. During the SAMS project, Linux and UniSQL was adopted and improved in order to meet the needs of sophisticated system. So, Database level of encryption system based on commercial UniSQL was studied and designed in order to increase security and not to harm infringement on privacy. In this paper, we show the procedural step and consideration of design UniSQL embedded encryption and decryption based on our experience. Design of architecture on UniSQL version 6.3 will be touched in this paper as well as detailed encryption module. After implementing encryption system on UniSQL, we simulated performance and compared query-processing factors between encryption embedded UniSQL and UniSQL without one. The results of performance evaluation shows reasonable performance compared with non-encryption function.;"Database encryption; DB security; e-government; NEIS; Privacy; SAMS; UniSQL";"Human resource management; Information dissemination; Online systems; Public key cryptography; Students; Database encryption; e-Government; National Education Information System (NEIS); School Affairs Management System (SAMS); UniSQL; Query languages";Conference Paper;Scopus

The global entity was initially hostile to security and lacking in command structure. The awareness program tactics were based on 21st century warfare techniques. The program didn't play on fear or talk-down to staff. It empowered them by pointing out how IT security could be applied at home and in their lives. An organization-wide security day took place. Also, the Chief Security Officer headed up a special hierarchy consisting of an Intelligence Officer and a Communications Officer. General staff, IT professionals and executives all received tailored communication. The program delivered training, events, E-learning modules and newsletters. The literature was translated into 20 languages. However, executive briefings were only one-page long. The management team were never told about a problem without also been told what was been done to mitigate it. In addition, new joiners became indoctrinated in IT security as part of their induction. The program started to make security second nature to some. It created a flutter of proactive responses from employees. More than 80% of IT Directors said the program put the organization in a stronger security position. The only problem - it was just a little too successful for the executives to handle. Below is a case study on the launch of a powerful, unique and comprehensive awareness and education program for a global entity, which we will refer to as Entity X. In the course of the case study, we will articulate the essential components of an effective and economical program, and explore some of the critical issues involved in developing it, rolling it out and institutionalizing it. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea grew from the Honeynet Project's 'Forensic Challenge, 2' a project designed to raise awareness, teach and inform those tasked with responding to threats of malicious network intrusion. Since teaching from evidence of actual incidents is far more powerful than the traditional approach of using contrived workbook exercises, the Manuka project called for the creation of a database that would store compromised system images for use in Incident Response and Computer Forensic courses. This is a case study of that development process, identifying the unique challenges overcome in completing Manuka by June, 2004. As an open source product that will be made available to the research and teaching community, it is hoped that through this paper interest will be stimulated to provide these researchers further ideas for use and enhancement. ©2004 IEEE.;;"Cataloging compromised system images (CCSI); Computer forensic courses; Ethernet; Teaching tools; College buildings; Computer software; Computer system firewalls; Computer systems; Cryptography; Imaging techniques; Information science; Local area networks; Metadata; Project management; Teaching; User interfaces; Medical education";Conference Paper;Scopus

A pre-post-comparison was conducted with a closing interview. Analysis of the data revealed four distinct views on computer science: media-oriented, mathematical, social, and design-oriented. Furthermore, the study showed that the teachers' beliefs could in some cases be altered by the computer science lessons. Some teachers, however, showed resilience towards conceptual change (belief perseverance).

But no one is ready to slow down just yet. We can view Gordon Moore's observation on transistor densification as just one aspect of a longer-term underlying technological trend - the Law of Accelerating Returns articulated by Kurzweil. Arguably, companies became somewhat complacent in the Moore era, happy to settle for the gains brought by each new process node. Although we can expect scaling to continue, albeit at a slower pace, the end of Moore's Law delivers a stronger incentive to push other trends of technology progress harder. Some exciting new technologies are now emerging such as multichip 3D integration and the introduction of new technologies such as storage-class memory and silicon photonics. Moreover, we are also entering a golden age of computer architecture innovation. One of the key drivers is the pursuit of domain-specific architectures as proclaimed by Turing award winners John Hennessy and David Patterson. A good example is the Xilinx's AI Engine, one of the important features of the Versal ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform) [1]. Today, the explosion of AI workloads is one of the most powerful drivers shifting our attention to find faster ways of moving data into, across, and out of accelerators. Features such as massive parallel processing elements, the use of domain specific accelerators, the dense interconnect between distributed on-chip memories and processing elements, are examples of the ways chip makers are looking beyond scaling to achieve next-generation performance gains. Next, the growing demands of scaling-out hyperscale datacenter applications drive much of the new architecture developments. Given a high diversification of workloads that invoke massive compute and data movement, datacenter architectures are moving away from rigid CPU-centric structures and instead prioritize adaptability and configurability to optimize resources such as memory and connectivity of accelerators assigned to individual workloads. There is no longer a single figure of merit. It's not all about Tera-OPS. Other metrics such as transfers-per-second and latency come to the fore as demands become more real-time; autonomous vehicles being an obvious and important example. Moreover, the transition to 5G will result in solutions that operate across the traditional boundaries between the cloud and edge and embedded platforms that are obviously power-conscious and cost-sensitive. Future workloads will require agile software flows that accommodate the spread of functions across edge and cloud. Another industry megatrend that will drive technology requirements especially in encryption, data storage and communication, is Blockchain. To some, it may already have a bad reputation, tarnished by association with the anarchy of cryptocurrency, but it will be more widely relevant than many of us realize. Who could have foreseen the development of today's Internet when ARPANET first appeared as a simple platform for distributed computing and sending email? Through projects such as the open-source Hyperledger, Blockchain technology could be game-changing as a platform for building trust in transactions executed over the Internet. We may soon be talking in terms of the Trusted Internet. The predictability of Moore's law may have become rather too comfortable and slow. The future requires maximizing the flexibility, agility, and efficiency of new technologies. With Moore's Law now mostly behind us, new adaptable and scalable architectures will allow us to further provide exponential return from technology in order to create a more adaptable and intelligent world. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author.";"Adaptable compute acceleration platform; Artificial intelligence; Domain specific architectures; Scale-out computing";"Acceleration; Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Engineering education; Memory architecture; Open source software; Rigid structures; Silicon photonics; Trusted computing; Adaptable compute acceleration platform; Domain specific architectures; Efficiency of new technologies; Parallel processing elements; Scalable architectures; Scale-out computing; Technological trends; Traditional boundaries; 5G mobile communication systems";Conference Paper;Scopus

In order to understand the interactions among these correlated aspects and elicit potential threats geared towards a given organization, different security requirements analysis approaches are proposed in the literature. However, the body of knowledge is yet to unleash its full potential due to the complex nature of security problems, and inadequate ways to improve security awareness of key players in the organization. Objective: Objective(s) of the research study is to improve the security awareness of players utilizing serious games via: (i) Know-how of security concepts and security protection; (ii) guided process of identifying valuable assets and vulnerabilities in a given organizational setting; (iii) guided process of defining successful security attacks to the organization. Method: Important methods used to address the above objectives include: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature to better understand security and game design elements; (ii) designing a serious game using cyber security knowledge and game-based techniques combined with security requirements engineering concepts; (iii) using empirical evaluation (observation and survey) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed game design. Result: The solution proposed is a serious game for security requirements education, which: (i) can be an effective and fun way of learning security related concepts; (ii) mimics a real life problem setting in a presentable and understandable way; (iii) motivates players to learn more about security related concepts in future. Conclusion: From this study, we conclude that the proposed Security Requirement Education Game (SREG) has positive results and is helpful for players of the game to get an understanding of security attacks and vulnerabilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.";"Cyber security; Empirical study; Organizational security; Requirements engineering; Security awareness; Security education; Security requirements inception; Serious game; Social engineering";"Cryptography; Education; Engineering education; Requirements engineering; Serious games; Technology transfer; Cyber security; Empirical studies; Organizational security; Security awareness; Security education; Security requirements; Social engineering; Security of data";Article;Scopus

Although a few encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature, they are not sufficiently efficient due to the lack of full consideration of the characteristics of surveillance videos, i.e., intensive global redundancy. By taking advantage of such redundancy, we design a novel method for encrypting such videos. We first train a background dictionary based on several frame observations. Then every single frame is parsed into the background and foreground components. Separation is the key to improve the efficiency of the proposed technique, since encryption is only carried out in the foreground, while the background is skillfully recorded by corresponding background recovery coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the state of the art, the proposed method is robust to known cryptanalytic attacks, and enhances the overall security due to the foreground and background separation. Additionally, our encryption method is faster than competing methods, which do not conduct foreground extraction. © 2015, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"background and foreground separation; surveillance videos; video encryption";"Monitoring; Redundancy; Security systems; Separation; Cryptanalytic attacks; Encryption methods; Encryption schemes; Foreground and background separations; Foreground extraction; Recovery coefficients; Surveillance video; Video encryption; Cryptography";Article;Scopus

Such conditions arise where systems are observed from outside of boundaries that arise through their observation, and where such systems refer to themselves in a circular fashion. It argues that the Enigma cipher machine is isomorphous with Heinz von Foersters portrayals of non-triviality in his non-trivial machine (NTM), but not with surprising human behaviour, and it demonstrates that the NTM does not account for spontaneity as it is observed in humans in general. © 2014 Higher Education Press Limited Company.;"Design; Enigma; Predictability; System boundaries";;Article;Scopus

One driving force of its growth is the ever increasing amount of data which is supposed to outpace the growth of storage capacity. This way, public cloud storage services enable organizations to manage their data with low operational expenses. However, the benefits of cloud computing come along with challenges and open issues such as security, reliability and the risk to become dependent on a provider for its service. In general, a switch of a storage provider is associated with high costs of adapting new APIs and additional charges for inbound and outbound bandwidth and requests. In this paper, we describe the design, architecture and implementation of Cloud-RAID, a system that improves availability, confidentiality and integrity of data stored in the cloud. To achieve this objective, we encrypt user's data and make use of the RAID-technology principle to manage data distribution across cloud storage providers. Our approach allows users to avoid vendor lock-in, and reduce significantly the cost of switching providers. In general, the data distribution is based on users' expectations regarding providers geographic location, quality of service, providers reputation, and budget preferences. In this paper, we also discuss the security functionality and reveal our observations on the overall performance when encrypting and encoding user's data. © 2013 IEEE.;;"Cloud storages; Data distribution; Driving forces; Geographic location; ITS Services; Operational expense; Public clouds; Storage capacity; Cloud computing; Computer science; Cryptography; Education computing; Engineering education; Quality of service; Security of data; Digital storage";Conference Paper;Scopus

Also, students encounter it as a phenomenon of their everyday lives, e.g. when using messengers that advertise encrypted communication. They will thus in most cases have preconceptions about what encrypted communication means that they will bring into the classroom. As in many cases, we expect these conceptions to be incomplete or even inappropriate. Knowing the extent and limitations of students' prior ideas informs lessons planning and, when addressed properly, fosters both learning and conceptual change. Therefore, we present the results of a mixed-methods investigation into the conception of secure messaging held by both K-12 students and pre-service teachers. We inductively coded written and drawn responses to a situated assessment administered as a questionnaire and, after refining the codesystem, tried to identify different types of conceptions by clustering the responses. Our results indicate that students first and foremost lack a clear understanding of networked communication that may subsequently prevent them from forming correct mental models about cybersecurity. As cybersecurity is a topic that is usually seen as part of a ""digital competence""- and as such may also be taught by subjects other than CS - we discuss how our findings might inform a cross-subject approach to teaching it. © 2020 ACM.";"Cryptography; Encryption; K-12; Mixed-methods study; Phenomenography; Qualitative study";"Cryptography; Curricula; Education computing; Security of data; Surveys; Conceptual change; Cyber security; Encrypted communication; Mental model; Mixed method; Pre-service teacher; Students";Conference Paper;Scopus

Ransomware, a variant of malware, encrypts files, data, and often locks computer systems, and retains the decryption key until victims pay a ransom. Current method of ransomware mitigation is the analysis and classification of the ransomware and its variants to propose solution for detection and prevention. This mitigation approach omits technology users as part of the solution especially given their role in falling prey to ransomware by means of social engineering attack vectors. The purpose of this qualitative study was to highlight current and emerging ransomware vectors, and to identify cyber security awareness and education solutions that can be applied to mitigate socially engineered ransomware attacks. A semi-structured interview with executives and managers from several financial, technology, construction, transportation, education, and health industries revealed the lack of current awareness and training approaches to mitigate against socially engineered ransomware attacks. This study recommends some specific cybersecurity training and awareness approaches to consider in order to enable technology users resist and mitigate against ransomware attacks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.;"Cybersecurity; Malware; Mitigation; Ransomware; Social engineering";"Cryptography; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Network security; Personnel training; Attack vector; Cyber security; Health industry; Qualitative study; Semi structured interviews; Social engineering; Malware";Conference Paper;Scopus

The U.S. Congress and other governmental and industrial organizations have recognized that teaching Quantum Computing in university-level Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs is strategically important for workforce development along with technology development. Success in this endeavor requires generating genuine interest in the topic and motivating potential students. Quantum Computing requires an understanding of relatively difficult related subjects including physics, math and computer science. Many computer science and electrical engineering students shy away from quantum computing because of its complexity. This paper discusses our success with generating interest in quantum computing among graduate students and motivating them through exploring, in related courses, some aspects of quantum computing that have the potential to generate discontinuities. The approach is also examined in terms of the Scientific Learning Cycle as discussed by Wankat Oreovicz. Opportunities and challenges of adding Quantum Computing to Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs were studied through a student small group project in a cybersecurity course. The work built on extensive research into the effectiveness of small group projects and the role of 'play' in learning. Our small group project on quantum computing was introduced three years ago into a cybersecurity course which is required for all students in our university's Masters in Computer Science and Masters in Electrical Engineering programs. The basic goals of the project are to teach students some basics of quantum computing by allowing them to 'play with it' and to alert students to the fact that quantum computing is a rapidly developing new field that they need to follow during at least the next decade. The small group project helped students to explore the potential of quantum computing to substantially undermine current Public Key Cryptography and, at the same time provide a new approach to encryption that is even more secure than Public Key Cryptography. A qualitative analysis of discussions and assigned tasks suggests that this strategy succeeded in generating significant interest in quantum computing among students. They became motivated and immersed in a difficult subject despite the requirement for investment of significant time and effort to understand a complex combination of physics, math and computer science. © 2019 IEEE.;"Cybersecurity; Learning Process; Motivation in Learning; Public Key Cryptography; Workforce Development";"Curricula; Engineering education; Engineering research; Motivation; Public key cryptography; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Teaching; Cyber security; Electrical engineering programs; Electrical engineering students; Industrial organization; Learning process; Qualitative analysis; Technology development; Workforce development; Students";Conference Paper;Scopus

We used principles drawn from research and theories in disciplines such as cognitive science, motivation, and education to design the tutorials. They were developed as part of the OpenDSA eTextbook project (http://algoviz. org/OpenDSA), an open source, online system combining textbook-quality content with algorithm visualizations and interactive exercises. DSA courses emphasize dynamic processes such as how various algorithms work. OpenDSA supports presenting such content in a highly visual manner through the frequent use of slideshows, simulations, and visualizations. Students were also provided a continuous stream of automated assessment questions and interactive exercises, thus providing immediate feedback to the students on their progress. A pilot study was conducted with students in a Computer Science course at Virginia Tech during Fall 2012. We tested three weeks of content on sorting and hashing in a quasi-experimental setting and collected quantitative and qualitative data. The data consisted of students' performance as measured by their grades, students' perceptions and opinions obtained on surveys, field notes from observing the classes, interview data at the end of the course, and the interaction logs that our system records. After the pilot test, students' average grade in the treatment group was slightly (but not significantly) better than the control group on the post test. Students' survey and interview data indicated positive feedback about OpenDSA, with the average response on how well they liked using the OpenDSA materials increasing after use as compared to a similar pretest question about whether they would like to use such materials. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.;;"Algorithm visualization; Automated assessment; Cognitive science; Computer Science course; Immediate feedbacks; Interactive exercise; Online tutorials; Qualitative data; Algorithms; Cryptography; Data structures; Engineering education; Feedback; Open systems; Students; Surveys; Teaching";Conference Paper;Scopus

The multidisciplinary nature of such systems makes it challenging to give students exposure to and experience in all their facets. This paper proposes a generic architecture, containing multiple processors, that allows easy integration of custom and/or predefined peripherals. The architecture allows students to explore both the hardware and software issues associated with real-time and embedded systems. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended to train students in advanced concepts in embedded multiprocessor systems. This generic architecture has been used for two courses at the National University of Singapore - one on real-time embedded systems and the other emphasizing the hardware aspects of embedded systems. The project in the real-time embedded systems course has students develop a five-a-side soccer system on multiple field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards using embedded processors. In the embedded hardware design course project, students use an embedded processor-based system to perform decryption of a block encrypted image, accelerated through a custom co-processor. The use of displays gives students a visual/interactive experience and a sense of accomplishment, while reinforcing the theoretical concepts. Both qualitative and quantitative assessment results are presented, showing how students perceived these projects and met the learning objectives. © 2013 IEEE.;"Embedded systems; field-programmable gate array (FPGA); hardware-software co-design; project-based learning; real-time systems";"Embedded multiprocessors; Embedded systems education; Hardware software codesign; National University of Singapore; Project based learning; Qualitative and quantitative assessments; Real-time and embedded systems; Real-time embedded systems; Computer architecture; Cryptography; Education computing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Real time systems; Students; Teaching; Embedded systems";Article;Scopus

In this paper, we develop methods to reveal counter-forensic activities in which an attacker estimates the camera fingerprint from a set of images and pastes it onto an image from a different camera with the intent to introduce a false alarm and, in doing so, frame an innocent victim. We start by classifying different scenarios based on the sophistication of the attacker's activity and the means available to her and to the victim, who wishes to defend herself. The key observation is that at least some of the images that were used by the attacker to estimate the fake fingerprint will likely be available to the victim as well. We describe the socalled ""triangle test"" that helps the victim reveal attacker's malicious activity with high certainty under a wide range of conditions. This test is then extended to the case when none of the images that the attacker used to create the fake fingerprint are available to the victim but the victim has at least two forged images to analyze. We demonstrate the test's performance experimentally and investigate its limitations. The conclusion that can be made from this study is that planting a sensor fingerprint in an image without leaving a trace is significantly more difficult than previously thought. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.";"Camera identification; Counter-forensics; Digital forensics; Photo-response non-uniformity; Sensor fingerprint";"Camera's sensors; Digital forensic; False alarms; Malicious activities; Nonuniformity; Photo-response non-uniformity; Photoresponses; Sensor noise; Agriculture; Computer graphics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Sensors; Cameras";Conference Paper;Scopus

However, no research has sought to identify which specific expertise should be strengthened. This study analyzed which competencies are required by professional police investigators in industrial espionage cases to gain expertise. The study used the Developing A Curriculum (DACUM) technique, normally used to develop curriculum through job analysis. The study produced a series of competency items in three stages: (1) created a job model, (2) filtered out unnecessary competency items via expert reviews, and (3) verified the selected items via surveys and focus group interviews. Unnecessary items were filtered out throughout the study. The study found that knowledge about laws related to industrial espionage, case types and modus operandi, and knowledge related to digital forensics and utilization of useful tools are necessary competencies for the police investigating industrial espionage cases. Several non-essential but beneficial competencies were also found, such as understanding of the latest technology trends, knowledge of internal computer systems and relevant organizations, and ability to use programs to design drawings or program source codes.. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.;"Competency; DACUM; Industrial espionage; Knowledge; Professional police investigator; Skill";;Article;Scopus

Digital devices are recovered and are forensically processed by the C&DF students. Investigative reports are forwarded to Paralegal students who work with local attorneys who act in the role of the prosecution and defence teams.

Despite that pressure, it is not clear how that need should be filled, for whom, and by whom. There are many published texts available on which one might base a course, though they are primarily written for English speaking countries. Given the differences in legal practices in different countries, and forensic's dependency on legal procedures, it is not clear how applicable such texts are to Swedish education in the subject. This paper summarises some of the ongoing work at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences at Stockholm University where we seek to define what the primary elements of a Swedish IT forensics education should be. Interviews conducted with specialists in IT law and IT forensics indicate that there are discrepancies between how representatives from on the one hand the public legal system and on the other private enterprise view the need and the subject matter.

Digital forensics techniques are already used in law to determine ownership of documents, and also in criminal cases, where it is not uncommon to hide information and images within an ordinary looking document using steganography techniques. These digital forensic techniques were used to investigate a known case of contract cheating where the contract author has notified the university and the student subsequently confirmed that they had contracted the work out. Microsoft Word documents use a format known as Office Open XML Format, and as such, it is possible to review the editing process of a document. A student submission known to have been contracted out was analysed using the revision identifiers within the document, and a tool was developed to review these identifiers. Using visualisation techniques it is possible to see a pattern of editing that is inconsistent with the pattern seen in an authentic document. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.;"Academic integrity; Contract cheating; Detection; Forensics; OOXML; Plagiarism";;Article;Scopus

Such research draws on a range of clinical and non-clinical data to make predictions about health risks, such as identifying epidemics and monitoring disease spread. Much of this research uses data from social media in the public domain or anonymous secondary health data and is therefore exempt from ethics committee scrutiny. While the ethical use and regulation of digital-based research has been discussed, little attention has been given to the ethics governance of such research in higher education institutions in the field of population health. Such governance is essential to how scholars make ethical decisions and provides assurance to the public that researchers are acting ethically. We propose a process of ethics governance for population health research in higher education institutions. The approach takes the form of review after the research has been completed, with particular focus on the role artificial intelligence algorithms play in augmenting decision-making. The first layer of review could be national, open-science repositories for open-source algorithms and affiliated data or information which are developed during research. The second layer would be a sector-specific validation of the research processes and algorithms by a committee of academics and stakeholders with a wide range of expertise across disciplines. The committee could be created as an off-shoot of an already functioning national oversight body or health technology assessment organization. We use case studies of good practice to explore how this process might operate. © 2020, World Health Organization.

However, with a widening and varied choice available to them, prospective students and employers require a means to identify academic degrees that offer appropriate and high-quality education in the subject area. This paper presents a case study of the establishment and operation of a certification programme for academic degrees in cyber security. It describes the means by which appropriate topic themes and subject areas for relevant degrees were identified and defined, leading to a certification programme that addresses degrees in general cyber security as well as notable specialisations including digital forensics and network security.

While notoriety is often gained for the investigations and case studies following large catastrophic failures, smaller scale investigations using these same principles occur almost daily on construction projects in the form of non-compliance, incident, and near-miss reports. However, these data are often rendered inaccessible upon project completion, and the learning opportunity to the wider community wasted, only remaining as tacit or experiential knowledge. Additionally, these data are predominantly captured in written prose, an unformatted style, therefore analysis is hindered by the lack of techniques to deal with data of this type. This results in restricting learning to fewer significant cases to avoid inundating people with constant minor alerts or updates. This paper will determine how recent research can be leveraged to implement learning from everyday forensic engineering by presenting a framework that uses recent developments in both the data analytic and natural language processing fields. It will demonstrate a hybrid natural language processing and knowledge discovery framework to transform everyday forensic engineering data into a valuable resource exploitable for learning. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.;"Failure; Knowledge discovery; Learning; Natural language processing";"Digital forensics; Engineering education; Forging; Natural language processing systems; Safety engineering; Catastrophic failures; Construction projects; Engineering principles; Experiential knowledge; Knowledge discovery framework; Learning opportunity; NAtural language processing; Performance problems; Forensic engineering";Conference Paper;Scopus

This article presents a proposal for the education, training and certified qualification of Brazilian police officers in order to prepare them so that they can be as knowledgeable, reliable, efficient and effective as possible. The proposal presents two types of training and qualification: the first, police officers whose primary focus is not cybercrime per se, but who as first responders are likely to encounter ICT activities as part of their work in fighting cybercrime; and the second, police officers who are involved in cybercrime investigations but expected to be classified as specialists. The proposal places strong emphasis on practical hands-on exercises, crime-scene hypothetical laboratories scenarios, actual and mock case studies and workshops to highly skilled Brazilian police officers as world class investigators. To meet this target, the proposal includes an outline of the proposed syllabus and laboratory practical sessions for each level of training to evolve specialist investigators. © 2016 IEEE.";"cybercrime investigators; digital forensic; Police cybercrime education & training; qualification; security";"Computer crime; Crime; Data handling; Data mining; Information science; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cybercrime; Digital forensic; Exponential growth; First responders; Hands-on exercise; Information communication technology; qualification; security; Law enforcement";Conference Paper;Scopus

The ubiquity of wireless and satellite communication and the rapid evolution of powerful devices that exploit this infrastructure have pushed mobile application development, in many instances, ahead of the capabilities to ensure the secure and safe utilization of these applications. The gap between capabilities and the ability to safeguard information assets must not be ignored, given the documented rise in the number and sophistication of threats and the broadening vulnerabilities of mobile applications and systems worldwide. We are focusing on how to integrate mobile apps/devices into our cyber security courses. In addition, case studies and hands-on labs are discussed in our practice.

The hacking threats of Cyber-crime are becoming more sophisticated as internet communication services are more popular. To further confirm the final finding of Cyber-crime, this study proposes three analytical tools to clarify the Cyber-crime issues by means of Ideal Log, M-N model and MDFA (Multi-faceted Digital Forensics Analysis) strategy, where Ideal Log is identified as a traceable element of digital evidence including four elements of IP Address, Timestamp, Digital Action, and Response Message. M-N model applies a formal method for collating and analyzing data sets of investigation-relevant logs in view of connected time with ISP logs. MDFA strategy attempts to outline the basic elements of Cyber-crime using new procedural investigative steps, and combining universal types of evidential information in terms of Evidence, Scene, Victim, and Suspect. After researchers figure out what has happened in Cyber-crime events, it will be easier to communicate with offenders, victims or related people. SoTE (Strategy of Triple-E) is discussed to observe Cyber-crime from the viewpoints of Education, Enforcement and Engineering. That approach is further analyzed from the fields of criminology, investigation and forensics. Each field has its different focus in dealing with diverse topics, such as: the policy of 6W1H (What, Which, When, Where, Who, Why, and How) questions, the procedure of MDFA strategy, the process of ideal Logs and M-N model. In addition, the case study and proposed suggestion of this paper are presented to counter Cyber-crime. © 2009 Da-Yu Kao, Shiuh-Jeng Wang & Frank Fu-Yuan Huang.;"Cyber criminology; Cyber-crime; Digital evidence; Triple-E strategy; Trojan defense";"Analytical tool; Basic elements; Cybercrime; Data sets; Digital evidence; Digital forensic; E-strategy; General publics; Internet communication services; IP addresss; Time-stamp; Trojans; Computer crime; Formal methods; Internet protocols; Internet service providers; Personal computing; Social sciences; Crime";Article;Scopus

However, no research has sought to identify which specific expertise should be strengthened. This study analyzed which competencies are required by professional police investigators in industrial espionage cases to gain expertise. The study used the Developing A Curriculum (DACUM) technique, normally used to develop curriculum through job analysis. The study produced a series of competency items in three stages: (1) created a job model, (2) filtered out unnecessary competency items via expert reviews, and (3) verified the selected items via surveys and focus group interviews. Unnecessary items were filtered out throughout the study. The study found that knowledge about laws related to industrial espionage, case types and modus operandi, and knowledge related to digital forensics and utilization of useful tools are necessary competencies for the police investigating industrial espionage cases. Several non-essential but beneficial competencies were also found, such as understanding of the latest technology trends, knowledge of internal computer systems and relevant organizations, and ability to use programs to design drawings or program source codes.. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.;"Competency; DACUM; Industrial espionage; Knowledge; Professional police investigator; Skill";;Article;Scopus

Groundwater use was also often said to alleviate smallholder poverty. However, there is growing evidence linking the expansion of groundwater-based agriculture with increasing socioeconomic inequalities in a context of declining water tables and rapid agrarian change. This paper analyzes the contrasted fortunes of different categories of farmers participating in the groundwater economy, depending on access to other resources including land, capital and labor. The study was conducted in a 3910 ha area in the Saiss plain (Morocco), where rapid agrarian transformations took place with the arrival of investors attracted by state subsidies and the possibility to carry out intensive groundwater-based agriculture. The study began with interviews with key informants to determine the role of groundwater use in farm trajectories. Then, an inventory was undertaken of all farms and of all wells and tube-wells in the study area. Next, the groundwater use per farm type was determined on a sample of 24 farms. Finally, the socioeconomic differentiation of farms was determined, based on the inequalities in access to groundwater, land, labor and financial capital. The results revealed contrasted fortunes of farmers involved in the groundwater economy. The boom in the groundwater economy benefitted entrepreneurial and well-endowed farmers who made intensive use of groundwater, while the effects of their overexploitation of groundwater fed the marginalization of family farmers. The results show that capital has replaced landownership as the dominant production factor, thereby re-qualifying what is a small farmer. Capital is not only required to obtain access to groundwater, but also to deal with the more risky agriculture frequently conducted in the groundwater economy. This leads to the exclusion of small family farmers who may quit the groundwater economy poorer than they entered it. The urgent need to control access to and use of groundwater in the face of declining water tables has little chance of producing results if socioeconomic inequalities remain unaddressed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"Capital; Farmers; Groundwater overexploitation; Inequalities; Morocco; Socioeconomic differentiation";"Access control; Agriculture; Economics; Groundwater resources; Landforms; Capital; Farmers; Groundwater overexploitation; Inequalities; Morocco; Groundwater; agricultural intensification; capital; exploitation; farmers attitude; groundwater; irrigation system; landownership; marginalization; questionnaire survey; smallholder; water economics; water table; Morocco";Article;Scopus

In countries such as Ghana, local and even national campaigns have been launched to expel the herders but they persist. This case-study which utilised interviews and group discussions involving farmers and herders, sought to understand the dynamics and subtleties of herders' resilience in an environment where natural resource access and use rights are tied to common property principles and where herders have no enshrined land and resource rights. Using territoriality as the analytical capsule, we found that the herders' persistence is related to mainly non-territoriality where the goal is to influence relationships and resource access but not control area.

The purposes of this study were to assess the magnitude of STF injuries, to identify contributing factors and to propose preventive actions to reduce injuries in potato, sugar beet and open field vegetable production in Finland. The material consisted of 1648 injury claim records and 22 interviews. The analysis showed 45% (n = 740) of the non-fatal injuries were STFs or jumps. Phrase analysis of injury descriptions provided further insight into the characteristics of STF injuries. The current findings suggest interventions should focus on making access paths (e.g. stairs, ladders, platforms) safer, minimising the need for mounting and dismounting equipment, decreasing manual material handling, improving contamination control and housekeeping in working areas and improving the safety of traffic areas and farmyards.;"Agriculture; Horticulture; Phrase analysis; Slip, trip and fall injuries";"Access control; Agricultural products; Agriculture; Materials handling; Sugar (sucrose); Sugar beets; Sugars; Contamination controls; Contributing factors; Fatal injuries; Finland; Horticulture; Manual material handlings; Phrase analysis; Preventive actions; Slip, trip and fall injuries; Occupational risks; accident prevention; adult; agricultural worker; article; disease duration; environmental factor; fall injury; Finland; hazard assessment; human; injury; injury severity; interview; jumping; materials handling; occupational accident; occupational hazard; occupational health; physical activity; risk factor; safety; slip injury; trip injury; walking; workman compensation; Accidental Falls; Adult; Aged; Agriculture; Female; Finland; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Workers' Compensation; Young Adult";Article;Scopus

In countries such as Ghana, local and even national campaigns have been launched to expel the herders but they persist. This case-study which utilised interviews and group discussions involving farmers and herders, sought to understand the dynamics and subtleties of herders' resilience in an environment where natural resource access and use rights are tied to common property principles and where herders have no enshrined land and resource rights. Using territoriality as the analytical capsule, we found that the herders' persistence is related to mainly non-territoriality where the goal is to influence relationships and resource access but not control area. Categorising their non-territorial expression into persuasive and aggressive forms, we provide a new platform for deconstructing farmer-herder relationships in the West African sub-region. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;"Conflict; Farmers; Fulani herders; Ghana; Resource access; Territoriality";"Access control; Conflict; Farmers; Fulani herders; Ghana; Resource access; Territoriality; Agriculture; common property resource; farmers attitude; natural resource; resilience; territoriality; Ghana; West Africa";Article;Scopus

These models rely heavily on observational data, typically collected from sensors. Increasingly this data comes from a wide range of sources. For example, agricultural models often require data from climate observations, soil conditions, on-farm equipment, seasonal forecasts, among others. Integration of these data with models is very time-consuming and often is repetitious across different models. Furthermore, automation of model runs is difficult due to the complexity of managing data dependencies. We have developed a distributed system, Senaps, to support automation of sensor data retrieval and coupling with model execution in a scalable way. It has been developed over many years across scientific disciplines, including water management, agriculture, aquaculture, and related Information, Communication and Technologies areas. It has been used, and is in use, by a diverse range of projects, resulting in a flexible system that is not tied to a specific domain. Senaps includes a publish-subscribe subsystem that handles ingestion of disparate time-series data. It supports stream processing, such as quality assurance and data checking, and automates data ingestion with monitoring and recovery. The storage and access subsystem is a scalable time-series backend with an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow third party developers to build on. It has a range of features including dynamic temporal aggregations; fine-grained access control to support data privacy and sharing (users can elect to share data between organisations); metadata for sensor data management; and controlled vocabularies. The focus of this paper is the model integration subsystem, which provides the model integration and automation features. This system builds on developments in cloud and container-based computing to isolate a user submitted models runtime environment and provide access to the data backend. APIs are provided to handle environment images (e.g. Linux with R), model definition, workflows (instances of a model), and running of model jobs. We have successfully used this system to automate model runs and provide continuous results from a number of parameterised models. We have hosted a number of models on the platform, including a timber drying model and two agricultural prediction models. Being tied to a robust sensor-data backend ensures models are run on the most recent data and removes the need for model developers to continuously manage model execution. Results from the model are automatically available and can be easily shared between users and organisations. In this paper, we detail the technical challenges in implementation, provide example results from a running model, and describe our next research steps. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

Validating the test infrastructure and its usage in the early design stages is critical to the success of the project. The new Internal Joint Test Action Group (IJTAG or IEEE 1687-2014) standard is a valuable component of this test infrastructure and is designed to promote efficient embedded instrument access. This paper describes one of first comprehensive applications of an IJTAG-based method to a state-of-the-art server microprocessor design from specification to production. We leveraged IJTAG to automate design modeling, enable faster and more advanced verification, and optimize manufacturing test access. In this work, we demonstrate a very high degree of optimization and automation, which is cost-efficiently enabled by IJTAG, and goes beyond the capabilities of typical in-house IJTAG-like system, currently in use in industry. © 2015 IEEE.;"ATPG test-setup; IEEE 1149.1; IEEE 1500; IEEE 1687; IJTAG; JTAG";"Access control; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuit testing; IEEE 1149.1; IEEE 1500; IEEE 1687; IJTAG; JTAG; Test setups; Design";Conference Paper;Scopus

In allusion to the explosive data and information of application system in current medicine manufacturing enterprise, we desire to propose a novel application information system integration platform in medicine manufacturing enterprise, which based on a combination of RFID technology and SOA, to implement information sharing and alternation. This method exploits the application integration platform across service interface layer to invoke the RFID middleware. The loose coupling in integration solution is realized by Web services. The key techniques in RFID event components and expanded role-based security access mechanism are studied in detail. Finally, a case study is implemented and tested to evidence our understanding on application system integration platform in medicine manufacturing enterprise. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;"Access control; Integration platform; Medicine manufacturing enterprise; Radio frequency identification; Service component; SOA";"article; client server application; computer language; computer security; drug manufacture; Internet; process design; radiofrequency identification; service oriented architecture; drug industry; human; information system; organization and management; radiofrequency identification; research; system analysis; theoretical model; Drug Industry; Humans; Information Systems; Models, Theoretical; Radio Frequency Identification Device; Research; Systems Integration";Article;Scopus

In this mechanism, it was based on the trust that the service providers authorize the sharing services to the virtual organizations (VO) or the other nodes. The trust evaluation function calculated the trust degree between the entities. The lowest trust degree which was allowed to access the sharing service was set in the authorization policies. The access subjects could access the sharing service if the trust degree of the access subject was higher than the allowed trust degree in the coarse-grain access control policy. A case study and algorithm simulation was presented to verify this mechanism could enhance the access control of the sharing service in the manufacturing grid.;"Access control; Authorization; Manufacturing grid; Trust";;Article;Scopus

This study presents an organisation structure-based access control (OSAC) model based on a task-role-based access control (T-RBAC) model. The OSAC model emphasises that employee authorisations are generated directly based on their position in the enterprise organisational structure. The proposed model extends the concepts of static separation of duty (SSD), dynamic separation of duty (DSD), prerequisite, and cardinality constraints in the role-based access control (RBAC) model to present department and role relations that identify the cooperative interactive relations among roles across department boundaries to facilitate resource sharing among roles and simplify enterprise resource management. Various relations and applied examples are demonstrated using the class model in unified modelling language (UML). Examples of inappropriate use of relations that lead to violation of relation are also presented. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model for most businesses, a case study involving an automobile component producer is presented and an OSAC model-based administrative management system is developed to ensure that appropriate resources can be legally used by the correct employees and at the right time. By applying the proposed model, administrators can easily manage resources based on an organisational structure perspective and the resource sharing capabilities of all departments can be improved.;"Authorisation; E-business; E-manufacturing; Organisational structure; T-RBAC";"Distributed computer systems; Electronic commerce; Human resource management; Manufacture; Modeling languages; Authorisation; eBusiness; Emanufacturing; Organisational structure; T-RBAC; Access control";Article;Scopus

Among them, access control for information confidentiality and integrity has attracted widespread attention. However, in the context of the contemporary dynamic business environment, the traditional workflow authorization model (WAM) faces limitations in handling the consequences of dynamic workflow changes and exceptions, since it focuses primarily on the synchronization of authorization flow by using authorization templates (ATs). In this paper, we propose a flexible access control with dynamic checking features for handling workflow changes and exceptions. Extended temporal role-based access control and flexible workflow authorization template are adopted in order to further enhance the traditional AT, thereby ensuring information confidentiality and integrity. Additionally, a case study applying the proposed model to uEngine, an open source workflow management system, is presented. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.;"Role-based access control; Workflow authorization model; Workflow system";"Computer aided manufacturing; Groupware; Information management; Interactive computer systems; Management; Security systems; Work simplification; Access Control models; Case studies; Dynamic business environments; Dynamic checking; Dynamic workflow; Flexible workflow; Information confidentialities; Open sources; Role-based access control; Security issues; Temporal roles; Workflow authorization model; Workflow Management systems; Workflow system; Access control";Conference Paper;Scopus

Its aim is to lower access barriers to integrated micro-nanotechnology (MNT) solutions by providing a portfolio of standardised multi-domain and multi-technology modules and prototyping platforms. The use of microsystem products in emerging markets such as biomedical and healthcare, environmental monitoring, etc requires integration of functions such as fluidic, optical, mechanical, electrical, biological, etc. No single material technology (silicon, polymer, glass) system can provide all these in a cost-effective way. For example, silicon is very attractive for its ability to provide very high liquid dispensing accuracy in microfluidics and also for integration with drive/signal processing electronics for intelligent sensors. However, other functions such as fluidic handling, interfacing and environmental packaging require hybridisation with other low-cost materials such as polymers. End-users without MNT expertise who would like to develop new functions and products or to improve their existing products through miniaturisation are guided through the complete development supply chain from concept, through design and feasibility studies, to prototyping and manufacturing. End-users who are familiar with MNT technology and/or have their own design concepts can access low-risk low-cost-of-entry prototyping services based on standardised processes, components and toolkits. Examples of the use of the toolkits available and case studies will be discussed in this paper. © 2007 IEEE.;;"Access control; Cost effectiveness; Environmental protection; Signal processing; Smart sensors; Software prototyping; Fluidic handling; Hybridization; Intelligent sensors; Nanotechnology";Conference Paper;Scopus

These factors include threats that are growing either in frequency (viruses and worms) or seriousness (terrorism), the widespread use of technologies that were not designed with security as a high-priority attribute, growing levels of connectivity between manufacturing control systems and higher-level business systems to achieve greater levels of productivity, and work processes that ignored the risk because historically these manufacturing control systems were not network-connected. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks corporations have begun to reexamine these risks and establish Cybersecurity programs to deal with them. The experience of Procter & Gamble provides a case study in how this process has evolved in one corporation and also provides an introduction to the international standards that are being developed in this area. These Cybersecurity programs are based on the risk management models that have been developed for process safety, personnel safety and environmental risk management but incorporate links into the IT organizations that typically own the Cybersecurity risks to corporate networks. These programs also involve linkages with physical security and business continuity planning. The scope of these programs includes technical issues such as network architecture, access control, use of anti-virus products and patch management as well as work process issues such as leadership, communication, coordination, results tracking and disaster recovery planning with the focus being to cost-effectively reduce risk to the organization.;;"Computer viruses; Control systems; Productivity; Risk management; Strategic planning; Cybersecurity program; Manufacturing control systems; Procter & Gamble (CO); Security of data";Conference Paper;Scopus

PCIM (policy core information model) is a generic information model proposed by IETF. This paper proposes a PCIM extension, called RBPIM (role-based policy information model), in order to represent network access policies based on the RBAC model. An RBPlM implementation framework based on the POP/PEP (policy decision point/policy enforcement point) approach is also presented. In the proposed framework, the communication between the PDP and the PEPs is implemented using the COPS (common open policy service) protocol, also defined by the IETF. The framework adopts the outsourcing approach, where the policy rules are evaluated by the PDP, as defined by the COPS standard. This paper evaluates the outsourcing model for access control by presenting a case study and the average response time of PDP under different load conditions. © 2003 IEEE.;"Access control; Access protocols; Computer integrated manufacturing; Context modeling; Delay; Network servers; NIST; Outsourcing; Quality of service; Resource management";"Computer integrated manufacturing; Computer networks; Computer resource management; Information theory; Outsourcing; Quality control; Quality of service; Access protocols; Context modeling; Delay; Network server; NIST; Resource management; Access control";Conference Paper;Scopus

Nowadays, a rapid development of Internet-based technologies with steadily increasing easiness in accessing any kind of information through the World Wide Web (WWW) would offer the possibility of developing a real-time collaborative system over the Internet. Two strategies are required to create such a system. One strategy is finding effective methods for communicating and sharing distributed product information, especially those related to design and manufacturing. Another strategy is developing Web-based approaches that support real-time sharing of platform-independent applications. In this paper, a concept for a multi-user collaborative assembly environment on the Internet is presented. The Client/Server structure of the environment, and the four main functional modules including: 1) integration and sharing of distributed product data through a STEP server; 2) session management including team management, user management and access control; 3) sharing of multimedia data (e.g. text, audio and video); 4) 3D collaborative assembly, are described. Finally, a scenario has been designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the environment to support distributed collaborative assembly design.";;"Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Computer aided manufacturing; Computer architecture; Enterprise resource planning; Information dissemination; Information technology; Internet; Knowledge engineering; Real time systems; Agent-based knowledge sharing; Conflict management; Platform-independent applications; Product data management (PDM); Computer supported cooperative work";Conference Paper;Scopus

Because multiple products are competing for limited resource, managers need to dynamically adjust production priority based on customer demand and distribution of work-in-processes (WIP). The production control in multi-product system becomes even more complicated when process queue time (PQT) constraints exist. Under PQT constraints, administrators setup upper limits for the waiting time between specific manufacturing steps to ensure quality of products. This upper limit of waiting time makes dynamic production control very challenging. The objective of this paper is to develop production control methods for multi-product systems subject to PQT constraints. However, it is computationally infeasible to solve multiple product problems in a single dynamic optimization model, and we therefore first formulate a single product admission control problems using Markov decision processes (MDP). Based on observations from the single product MDP model, an innovative multiple product admission control (MPAC) heuristic is developed. In simulation study, we compare the performance of MPAC with other popular dispatching methods in literature. Compare to other control methods in literature, the proposed (MPAC) method can reduce production costs by at least 33.8% and reduce scrap count by at least 59.5% in average. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;"Admission control; Manufacturing system modeling; Process time window constraint; Resource allocation; Semiconductor manufacturing";"Access control; Markov processes; Optimization; Production control; Resource allocation; Semiconductor device manufacture; Dispatching methods; Dynamic optimization models; Manufacturing system modeling; Markov Decision Processes; Multi-product systems; Process time; Semiconductor manufacturing; Semiconductor manufacturing systems; Manufacture";Article;Scopus
