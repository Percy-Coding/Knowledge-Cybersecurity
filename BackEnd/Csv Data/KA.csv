100;Data Security;Focuses on the protection of data at rest, during processing, and intransit.This knowledge area may require the application of mathematicaland analytical algorithms.
101;Software Security;Focuses on the development of software with security and potentialvulnerabilities in mind so that it cannot be easily exploited.The security of a system, and of the data it stores and manages,depends in large part on the security of its software. The security ofsoftware depends on how well the requirements match the needsthat the software is to address, how well the software is designed,implemented, tested, and deployed and maintained. Thedocumentation is critical for everyone to understand theseconsiderations, and ethical considerations arise throughout thecreation, deployment, use, and retirement of software.
102;Component Security;Focuses on the design, procurement, testing, analysis andmaintenance of components integrated into larger systems.The security of a system depends, in part, on the security of itscomponents. The security of a component depends on how it isdesigned, fabricated, procured, tested, connected to othercomponents, used and maintained. Together with the ConnectionSecurity and System Security KAs, the Component Security KAaddresses the security issues of connecting components and usingthem within larger systems.
103;Connection Security;Focuses on the security of the connections between componentsincluding both physical and logical connections.It is critical that every cybersecurity professional has a basicknowledge of digital communications and networking. Connectionsare how components interact. Together with the ComponentSecurity and System Security KAs, the Connection Security KAaddresses the security issues of connecting components and usingthem within larger systems.
104;System Security;Focuses on the security aspects of systems that are composed ofcomponents and connections, and use software.Understanding the security of a system requires viewing it not onlyas a set of components and connections but also as a completeunit in and of itself. This requires a holistic view of the system.Together with the Component Security and Connection SecurityKAs, the System Security KA addresses the security issues ofconnecting components and using them within larger systems.
105;Human Security;Focuses on protecting individuals’ data and privacy in the context oforganizations (i.e., as employees) and personal life, in addition tothe study of human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity.Humans have the responsibility to ensure the confidentiality,integrity, and availability (CIA) of their organizational and personalcomputer systems.
106;Organizational Security;Focuses on protecting organizations from cybersecurity threats andmanaging risk to support the successful accomplishment of theorganization’s mission.Organizations have the responsibility to meet the needs of manyconstituencies and those needs must inform risk management,security governance, business continuity, and security programmanagement.
107;Societal Security;Focuses on aspects of cybersecurity that broadly impact society asa whole for better or for worse.Cybercrime, law, ethics, policy, privacy and their relation to eachother are the key concepts of this knowledge area. The threat ofcybercrime across global society is serious and growing. Laws,ethics, and policies are vital to the security of corporate andgovernment secrets and assets, as well as to the protection ofindividual privacy and identity.
108;New Trends;New trends in cybersecurity based on events and research in the last year.
